This bathroom needed to transform into a fun, Spanish-inspired, functional space for daily use.”Chaudhuri uses Houzz Pro business software for all of her proposals, invoices and design selections through the Room Boards feature. Main feature. “The key goal was creating visual interest while utilizing durable materials,” Chaudhuri says. “In order to honor the Spanish style of the home, bold-patterned ceramic tile with a traditional encaustic look was installed to create a focal wall behind the vanity and new floating shelves. Warm red ceramic penny tiles accented by dark brown grout creates an easy-to-maintain yet bold flooring.  A carved wood vanity and warm wood shelves bring both visual and physical texture to the space.”Other special features. Satin brass fixtures with matte black accessories. Natural woven-fiber storage baskets and accents. Designer tip. “Small spaces don’t need to be boring,” Chaudhuri says. “Small bathrooms are a great chance to implement bold colors and patterns. Embrace the heritage of your home to guide your choice of pattern and color palette.”“Uh-oh” moment. “Supply chain issues continue to be unpredictable, even with the most careful planning,” Chaudhuri says. “Due to quick changes in availability, we needed to quickly pivot to a different — yet equally gorgeous — patterned tile for the accent wall. The penny tile also presented supply problems. This particular color and price point was hard to replicate with another option. Luckily, by the time we had settled on another option, our original choice was back in stock.”Find a bathroom designer near youà la carte DESIGNSave Photo2. Rustic RichnessDesigner: Jeane Dole of à la carte DesignLocation: DenverSize: 36 square feet (3.3 square meters)Homeowners’ request. “A powder room may be the most publicly visible room in anybody’s home,” designer Jeane Dole says. “The homeowners are in it constantly and virtually every visitor to the home is likely to use this space. This powder room was super basic — make that boring — and not arranged in a convenient manner at all. The vanity was directly in front of you as you entered, which is fine, but the toilet was immediately on your right, which made it very tight near the door. There was no good reason for this arrangement and there was plenty of space to position the toilet on the same wall as the vanity, so that’s what I recommended. Now you enter the room and everything is beautifully arranged on the same wall. Beyond this request, the clients left it to me to identify finishes that would complement their semi-rustic style.”Main feature. “In any room, one must consider the view as you enter,” Dole says. “With the new layout, the view is all laid out in front of you with a full-height tiled feature behind another feature, the custom-built vanity. The wall sconce [not shown] and metal mirror round out the simple yet rustic feel the client was looking for.”Other special features. “The extra-thick countertop and the gooseneck oil-rubbed bronze faucet add to the rustic charm of this powder room,” Dole says. “Then, the use of a burnt orange on all the other walls brings the rustic into today, providing some great contrast to what otherwise is a pretty neutral palette.”Shop from a curated collection of popular bathroom vanitiesThe Sitting RoomSave Photo3. Berry BurstDesigner: Megan Jackson Meder of The Sitting RoomLocation: Deephaven, Minnesota Size: 33 square feet (3.1 square meters); 5 feet, 2 inches by 6 feet, 4 inchesHomeowners’ request. “The clients wanted a modern and dramatic introduction to their home for their guests,” says designer Megan Jackson Meder, who used Houzz ideabooks to coordinate inspiration ideas with her clients. Main feature. “We debated between a wallpaper or tile and ultimately fell so in love with this tile we decided to put it on all of the walls,” Jackson Meder says. “They love bold colors, so we went with a deep berry paint for the floating wall vanity.”Other special features. Brass sconce and mirror. Designer tip. “Be bold in your powder room,” Jackson Meder says. “It’s mainly for guests, so have fun with it and show off your personality.”Tile: Nova, 12 by 24 inches, Emser Tile; sconce: Jewett, Hudson Valley Lighting; vanity paint: Mulberry in high-gloss, Benjamin MooreTimeless Design by Kate FitzGerald-WilksSave Photo4. Brass-and-Blue BeautyDesigner: Kate FitzGerald-Wilks of Timeless DesignLocation: Hockessin, DelawareSize: 32½  square feet (3 square meters); 5 by 6½ feet Homeowner’s request. “After designing and renovating this client’s entire first floor, including the kitchen, pantry, living room, dining room and study, she decided the powder room was no longer up to snuff,” designer Kate FitzGerald-Wilks says. “We kept the color scheme consistent and sourced really special pieces and finishes that are sure to wow her guests.” Main feature. “Our client fell in love with this wallpaper when we originally presented it to her for her study, but she ultimately decided against wallpaper for that space,” FitzGerald-Wilks says. “We decided the powder room was the perfect place to show it off and built the rest of the space around it.”Other special features. Custom wainscoting. Blue vanity. Gold hardware, plumbing fixtures, lighting and mirror. “In a small space like a powder room, we feel it’s important that every element be special but not overwhelming,” FitzGerald-Wilks says. Designer tip. “Are you afraid of integrating bold pattern into your home? A powder room is a great space to add a commanding pattern or color,” FitzGerald-Wilks says. “It’s a large statement but on a smaller scale, and because you’ll only spend a few minutes at a time in the space, it won’t feel overwhelming.”“Uh-oh” moment. “Believe it or not, our biggest challenge in this tiny room came from an existing outlet placement,” FitzGerald-Wilks says. “We met with our master carpenter as we were hashing out the final height on the wainscot installation and discovered the outlet to be in just the wrong spot to accommodate our ideal height. The client was not keen on the idea of moving the outlet, so after reflecting on the challenge, I determined the outlet and its plate could be rotated 90 degrees, and with minimal repair our wainscot could go in at just the right height.”Wallpaper: Mulberry Tree in navy, Thibaut; vanity: Thornton in Bright Navy and Carrara, 30 inches, Signature Hardware; mirror Haya Scalloped in gold, Uttermost; light fixture: Broche in antique gold, Crystorama LightingNew to home remodeling?

Flower PowerDesigner: Miranda Cullen of Inside StoriesLocation: Littleton, ColoradoSize: 24 square feet (2.2 square meters); 4 by 6 feetHomeowners’ request. “The vision was dark, moody and beautiful,” designer Miranda Cullen says. Main feature. Floral wallcovering (Magnolia Frieze in charcoal by Osborne & Little). “The wallcovering was the first piece selected for this beautiful powder room and everything else was selected to complement it,” Cullen says. Other special features. White-and-brass washstand. Ruffle-frame mirror. Textured wide-plank white oak flooring. Antique rug. Kohler Veil smart toilet. Designer tip. “Don’t be afraid to go dark and bold in small spaces,” Cullen says. “It won’t ‘close in’ the space.”More on HouzzRead more bathroom storiesBrowse bathroom photosFind a bathroom

That meant replacing an abundance of floral wallpaper and pink tile with a fresh new look and opening up a cramped shower-tub combo enclosed by frosted glass.For help transforming the dated space, they hired designer Natalie Pozzesi. They realized the shower-tub concept wasn’t working and decided to ditch the tub for a more spacious frameless glass shower with a handheld wand that gives the kids something easy to use. That decision allowed for a larger custom rift-sawn walnut double vanity that improves on storage and style. And speaking of style, bright blue tile in a geometric pattern spans an entire wall, punching up the design with a midcentury look that nods to the era of the home. Before PhotoThayer Design BuildSave Photo“After” photos by Realiant PhotographyBathroom at a GlanceWho lives here: A young couple with three kidsLocation: Corvallis, OregonSize: 70 square feet (6.5 square meters)Designer: Natalie Pozzesi of Thayer Design BuildBefore: Although the family has a full bathroom in a finished basement, this bathroom is the only one on the main floor. In the former space, shown here, shabby pink tile, floral wallpaper and inadequate lighting made for a busy and drab look. The wallpaper was peeling in some spots, and the doors and drawers on the worn wood vanity didn’t work properly. Plus, for this family of five, a single sink wasn’t cutting it. And the enclosed shower-tub combo was a pain to use. “Bathing kids in that tub made it really difficult,” Pozzesi says. “It was hard to reach in and get in and out of the tub.”Thayer Design BuildSave PhotoAfter: Pozzesi took the bathroom down to the studs and replaced the shower-tub combo with a spacious low-curb shower with a frameless glass enclosure that gives the layout some breathing room. This move also freed up space for the new double vanity in rift-sawn walnut with slab fronts, a nod to midcentury modern style.“Walnut was sticking with the midcentury theme and era-appropriate,” Pozzesi says. “We also wanted to bring in some contrast since the homeowners knew they wanted white countertops and other white elements.”Pozzesi placed cabinets beneath each sink and, below those, a drawer. “Normally when you do a drawer under a sink, it’s usually just a false panel,” Pozzesi says. “By reconfiguring it this way, it gives them more storage and the drawers are also in reach for the kids.”Spanning the entire vanity wall and into the shower is 8-inch blue hexagonal porcelain tile with a geometric pattern. “We originally knew we wanted to do some type of geometric tile,” Pozzesi says. “We started out with something pretty plain, but it felt sterile. This pattern stuck with the midcentury theme but also modernized it.”Elsewhere, glossy white 3-by-12-inch ceramic tiles in a herringbone pattern add a subtle design and help enhance light from a new vanity light and recessed ceiling lights. “Those tiles specifically have some texture to them, so they’re not completely flat,” Pozzesi says. “The herringbone pattern adds interest and gives some direction to the wall.”Cabinet pulls: Jute bar pull in Brushed, Kohler; vanity light: LED Bath Bar in brushed nickel, Kichler Find a bathroom designer near youThayer Design BuildSave PhotoBrushed nickel faucets coordinate with other brushed nickel finishes in the room. Blue-gray wall paint (Passive by Sherwin-Williams) complements the blue wall tile. The marble-look quartz countertop is an easy-to-maintain surface that works with the design approach. “We wanted something in keeping with the midcentury look,” Pozzesi says. “It’s very common in midcentury to have a white top. We didn’t want anything to overshadow the geometric tile, and wanted just a bit of movement there.”A custom medicine cabinet features interior wood shelves and two electrical outlets.

The shower features a rain head mounted in the ceiling and a hand-held shower head on the wall, both in a brushed nickel finish. “The hand shower you see on the wall is adjustable,” Pozzesi says. “I think they realized they were giving up a tub and wanted something that was adjustable for the kids. The overhead shower gives them that luxury feel.”The shower also includes a portable teak bench and a niche for products, backed in the same glossy white tile in a herringbone pattern. “On the top part of the niche we routed in an LED strip light that highlights the movement in that herringbone tile nicely,” Pozzesi says.Shower fixtures: Cia, MoenThayer Design BuildSave PhotoAn LED light strip under the vanity gives the cabinet a floating effect. “We wanted that luxury bathroom feel, and it also doubles as a nightlight for the kids,” Pozzesi says.The heated bathroom floor is 12-by-24-inch gray wood-look porcelain tile. “We wanted to play off the other colors and have the floor be neutral and not distract from the other details,” Pozzesi says. The device you see on the wall by the window is the electronic control for the floor heat.Before PhotoThayer Design BuildSave PhotoBefore: This photo taken from inside the former shower-tub combo shows the toilet area across from the vanity. While the toilet was in good shape, the cabinet above it had water damage. “It was too high for them also,” Pozzesi says.New to home remodeling? Learn the basicsThayer Design BuildSave PhotoAfter: The family kept the toilet but added a new custom cabinet and open shelf that coordinate with the vanity. “There’s an outlet inside for the speaker you see on the shelf there,” Pozzesi says. “There’s also adjustable shelves inside where they can store towels and an overflow supply of toilet paper.”More on HouzzRead more bathroom storiesBrowse

64047990,,"['Monthly Home Checklists', 'Organizing', 'Sheltering at Home']",2023-03-26,https://www.houzz.com/magazine/your-spring-organizing-checklist-stsetivw-vs~64047990,Your Spring Organizing Checklist,"Spring cleaning may get more of the hype, but I would argue that spring organizing is even more important. When your belongings are neat and tidy, your whole home feels cleaner and more inviting, and daily life is easier and more pleasant. If you’ve got the spring-cleaning bug, don’t stop there. Take advantage of your motivation and devote a weekend (or two) to clearing out clutter and getting organized all around the house. SGDI - Sarah Gallop Design Inc.Save PhotoEntrywayClear out any lingering winter boots and mittens, unread stacks of mail and anything else that doesn’t belong.Add enough hooks, shelves and baskets to hold your belongings when you come in the door.If you have a drawer near your entrance, place a drawer organizer inside to keep small items neat, and be sure to have a recycling bin within reach for tossing junk mail.10 Times to Hire a Professional OrganizerCoppice GuildSave PhotoKitchenMove the hardest-working tools (wooden spoons, tongs) front and center, and get rid of seldom-used single-purpose tools.Reshuffle your cabinet contents to move less frequently used items and entertaining supplies to the highest shelves and least-accessible areas, and your everyday basics within easy reach.Find a casserole dish that belongs to a friend? Aunt Sally’s serving spoons? Make a pile of to-return items and bring it to your car.LindalsköketSave PhotoTip: Make a morning cupboard. If your mornings tend to be rushed, consider carving out a nook in a cupboard where you can keep all your morning necessities together. A shelf or two can hold coffee- and tea-making supplies and breakfast favorites, as well as lunch containers if you pack a lunch, for either yourself or your children. Find coffee and tea products in the Houzz Shop Advance Design Studio, Ltd.Save PhotoLaundry RoomRecycle old, empty containers, and ditch any laundry products you don’t like, to make some space. Decanting laundry supplies into other containers is not necessary to create a lovely, organized space — just corral the assorted containers on a tray or in a bin. This serves the double purpose of looking nice and making it easier to move everything aside to clean.Add a triple-sorter laundry basket to help avoid the dreaded laundry-room-floor pileup. Give each family member an individual basket so you can keep clothes separated, making it easier to sort afterward.Shop for baskets Shira Gill| | Organization and StylingSave PhotoLinen ClosetIf you’ve been accumulating bedding and towels for years without getting rid of old sets, chances are you have more than you need. Two or three sets of sheets per bed, and two sets of towels per person (more if you have swimmers in the house), plus an extra set for guests, are generally plenty. Choose the best and donate the rest — and if your old linens are in bad shape, drop them in a textile recycling bin rather than the trash.Tip: Keep piles of towels and sheets from toppling over by using a shelf divider and tucking each set of sheets inside a pillowcase. Store small items  inside labeled storage boxes.Shelter ResidentialSave PhotoBedroomYour bedroom should be a peaceful haven devoted to rest. But often the bedroom ends up being a repository for piles of laundry and clutter — not the makings of a good night’s sleep! Sort through your clothes, setting aside a pile to give away, and neatly fold and put away the rest.Remove old coffee cups and water glasses, papers and any other junk that doesn’t belong in your bedroom.Peek under the bed. Neat underbed storage boxes can be helpful if they’re filled with things you honestly need, use or love. Just don’t let under your bed become a hiding spot for items you should give away or sell.Find a professional organizer near youSuzi Appel PhotographySave PhotoBathMuch of the clutter in the bathroom comes from products tried and not liked. These unloved items end up getting shoved to the back of the cupboard, where they take up precious space and gather dust. Ruthlessly sort through your bath and beauty products. Toss out everything you do not use, and recycle the containers if possible. Once everything is cleared out, choose one or two baskets or trays to keep the products you use daily neatly contained.If you have been storing medications in the bathroom, move them to a different location — the humidity can be damaging. Choose a place that is cool, dry and out of reach of children.Save PhotoBooksThe first edit of your book collection should be books you bought (or were given) that you didn’t end up liking very much. Next, consider pulling out any books you enjoyed but realistically will not pick up again. If you have specific friends you think would love certain books, put these in a tote bag and put them in your car — better to actually pass them along than to just think about it! Donate unwanted books to a local library or Goodwill, or, if you want to make a little extra cash, take them to a local used-book seller.Farrow & BallSave PhotoPapers and Printed PhotosWalk through your house and gather up all of the random, unsorted piles of paper you can find, making one stack. Go through this stack with a recycling bin and shredder until it’s all gone. Put upcoming events on your calendar, file important records and pay bills as needed. To quickly handle a big pile of printed photos, sort them roughly by date and file them in photo boxes.Tip: If traditional filing cabinets just aren’t working for you, consider switching to a more flexible (and portable) system consisting of small file boxes or expanding files. The beauty in using file boxes is that they take up only as much space as you need, and you can keep one small box near the entry for easily (and quickly) filing important papers.Simplifying: Which Papers to Keep and Which to TossJessica Risko Smith Interior DesignSave PhotoTech Devices and Digital PhotosErase your data from old devices, then drop them in a cell phone recycling bin or return them to your cell-service provider for a credit. Back up your current computer and other devices to an external hard drive, as well as a cloud-based service for extra security. Order a photo book or prints from last year’s digital photos, and create a simple plan for organizing digital photos in the future. Keep them in files labeled with the month, and tag your favorites so you can easily gather them into a book or an album when the time comes.Tip: Whenever you get a promotional email you do not want to receive, scroll down to the bottom and click “unsubscribe” before deleting. Cutting back on unnecessary marketing emails will save you time in the long run — and might save you money as well, as you are not reminded of things to buy!How to Organize Your Digital PhotosLeroy Merlin OFFICIELSave PhotoGarden Tools and Supplies Toss out worn-out gloves and long-expired seed packets, and recycle empty packaging. Use wall-mounted grips to store long-handled tools, and stash short-handled gardening tools point-down in a bucket of sand. Tools should be stored out of the elements, so if you don’t have a garage or storage shed, consider investing in a small outdoor storage cabinet where you can keep these items safely protected.Share: What organizing projects are you working on?

The majority of homeowners who responded to our survey remodeled or decorated their home in 2022, and plan to remain in their home for 11 years or more following the renovation. More than half also are planning home projects in the coming year. “Faced with shortages of housing stock and high interest rates, we’re seeing homeowners update their current home to make the space more functional for the long term,” says Liza Hausman, vice president of industry marketing at Houzz. “We’re also seeing an uptick in additions, with the vast majority of homeowners hiring professionals to achieve their goals.”In addition to showing new highs for renovation activity, the report also shares that spending is on the rise and kitchens and bathrooms are getting larger. See more about those findings and other home remodeling and decorating trends from the new study below. Save Photo1. Renovation Activity ContinuesThe majority of homeowners (58%) tackled a renovation project in 2022. Plus, more homeowners decorated in 2022 (57%) than in 2021 (55%). And the share of homeowners who made home repairs (48%) and built new homes (5%) also rose 2 points each year over year.Save PhotoMeanwhile, the median spend continues to increase too. The national median renovation spend per household increased from $18,000 in 2021 to $22,000 in 2022.For homeowners with a larger budget (the top 10% of spend), the spend rose from $100,000 in 2021 to $140,000 or more in 2022. Keep in mind that the median spend throughout the study is not adjusted for inflation. Also keep in mind that the median means that half of the people spent more and half spent less; it’s not the average. Economists like to reference the median, or midpoint, figure rather than the average because the average can be skewed, can be volatile year over year and can be misleadingly high or low because of a single project that costs far more or less than others.The study gathered these median spending costs and other details from more than 46,000 homeowners who responded to survey questions. The projects reported were handled with the help of pros, were DIY or combined the two approaches.Find a pro to help with your remodeling projectRehkamp Larson Architects, Inc.Save PhotoSave Photo2. Plans to Renovate Also ContinueMany homeowners have future home projects in mind. More than half (55%) plan to renovate in 2023. And nearly half (48%) have decorating projects on the horizon, as well as home repairs (35%) and homebuilding projects (3%).The median planned spend on 2023 renovations is $15,000, the same as it was in 2022. Homeowners with higher-budget projects (the top 10% of spend) plan to spend $85,000 in 2023, up $10,000 (from $75,000) in 2022.But it’s worth pointing out that many home remodeling and design professionals expect slowed growth in 2023, following strong years in 2022 and 2021, according to the 2023 Houzz U.S. State of the Industry report.Shop for furniture and other products for your homeFlourish Interiors by Vanessa C SmithSave PhotoSave Photo3.

Homeowners Rely on Diverse Funding MethodsWhen it comes to paying for a home project, cash from savings remains by far the most common funding source (82%). But homeowners do tap into a variety of sources. The share of those who secured a home loan in 2022 to tackle a home project ticked up slightly, going from 14% in 2021 to to 16% in 2022.Cash from a home sale is steadily growing in popularity as a funding source — 13% used this source in 2022, compared with 11% in 2021 and 9% in 2020.Credit cards, on the other hand, are becoming less popular. The share of homeowners using credit cards to fund home projects dropped 10 points year over year, to 28% in 2022.Baran Studio ArchitectureSave PhotoSave Photo5. Motivation of Selling Declines in PopularityNearly 3 in 5 homeowners (61%) plan to stay in their home for 11 years or more following a 2022 renovation. And the share of homeowners tackling a remodel with a plan to soon sell their home has steadily declined since 2018. Only 6% of renovating homeowners cited selling their home as a motivation to renovate in 2022, compared with 9% in 2021 and 12% in 2018.The top two reasons homeowners tackled a home project in 2022 were finally having the time and finally having the financial means, both at 37%.Sho & Co.Save PhotoSave Photo6. Top Challenges Remain ConsistentThe vast majority of homeowners (92%) continue to report renovation challenges. Finding the right service providers remains the top challenge (33%), followed by finding the right products (28%).Staying on budget is an increasing concern, with 27% citing it for 2022 projects, compared with 23% in 2020. So is staying on schedule (21% in 2022 compared with 18% in 2020).And nearly a fifth of homeowners reported dealing with unexpected circumstances.Dexign Matter StudioSave PhotoSave Photo7. More Homeowners Are Expanding Living SpacesAfter four years of steady expansion activity, the share of renovating homeowners adding square footage has increased. One in 10 homeowners expanded a living space with an add-on in 2022, compared with 8% each year from 2018 through 2021. The average number of addition projects undertaken also has increased, from fewer than three in both 2020 and 2021 to more than three in 2022.Consistent with previous years, interior spaces are the most popular to renovate (72%), and homeowners tackle an average of nearly three interior projects at a time. Home system and exterior upgrades also are popular, while the share of homeowners renovating outdoor spaces continues to decline —  57% in 2020, 54% in 2021 and 51% in 2022.Tamara Heather Interior Design, LLCSave PhotoSave Photo8. More Kitchens and Bathrooms Are Getting BiggerKitchen and bathroom remodels remained the top renovation projects homeowners tackled in 2022. In fact, an even larger share of homeowners upgraded kitchens and  bathrooms (30% and 27%, respectively) than in 2021 (28% and 25%, respectively). More homeowners in 2022 expanded these spaces with additions than in the previous year.While the median spend for renovations of several types of interior rooms rose in 2022, the increase is especially notable for home office remodels. The median spend for those reached $2,000, compared with $1,200 in 2021.Revelry Interior DesignSave PhotoSave Photo9. New Highs for Kitchen and Bathroom SpendThe median spend on kitchen and primary bathroom remodels has increased steadily during the past three years.In 2022, the median spend for kitchens reached $20,000.

So they contacted designer Natasha Nuttall to help them turn their neglected patch into a serene space where they could enjoy being outdoors and entertain with ease. Undeterred by the tight dimensions of the plot, Nuttall cleverly fitted in a lounge area, a dining table, a casual seating spot and an outdoor kitchen, all softened and partially hidden by lush plantings.Natasha Nuttall Garden DesignSave PhotoPhotos by Eleanor WalpoleYard at a GlanceWho lives here: A couple with two teenage daughtersLocation: East LondonSize: 701 square feet (65 square meters); 16½ by 42½ feet (5 by 13 meters)Landscape designer: Natasha Nuttall Garden DesignThe owners aren’t avid gardeners, but they wanted an easy-to-maintain leafy retreat where they could hang out almost year-round with their daughters and entertain friends.Find a local landscape designerBefore PhotoSarah AlcroftSave PhotoBefore: The plot they inherited wasn’t doing the job. “It was basically a lawn that was failing and a rickety old patio, and the fence was falling down,” Nuttall says. You can see from this photo how narrow the space is. Nuttall had to plan carefully to fit in all the elements the owners requested.New to home remodeling? Learn the basicsNatasha Nuttall Garden DesignSave PhotoAfter: Nuttall’s trick to slotting so much into the yard was to soften the paving and boundaries with plants. “They’re not huge beds, but I tried to fit in as much as possible and plant quite densely,” she says. “I made sure the planting spilled over the edges to soften the hard landscaped areas.”She explains that dense plantings also help to expand a space, because they create a bit of mystery; as you walk through the landscape, different areas are revealed.At the corner of this bed by the rear patio is dwarf Japanese mock orange (Pittosporum tobira ‘Nanum’, USDA zones 9 to 10; find your zone), which, Nuttall says, “adds shape but isn’t too formal or fast-growing.” There are also ‘Starlight’ Chinese silver grass (Miscanthus sinensis ‘Starlight’, zones 5 to 9) and  evergreen golden sweet flag (Acorus gramineus ‘Ogon’, zones 5 to 9), adding height, softness and movement to the beds.Note: Some species of Miscanthus can self-seed and be considered invasive, depending on the locale and the site’s conditions. Check with your local nursery before planting.Natasha Nuttall Garden DesignSave PhotoThe seating area at the back of the yard can accommodate a crowd. A pergola provides shade for summer days, while a fire pit (just visible on the far left) keeps the area usable in cooler seasons.There’s summer storage under a lift-up lid within the right-hand section of the bench; in the winter, the cushions are stored indoors. “The ‘floating’ section [of the bench] is underplanted, and there’s a light under there, which looks really nice in the evening,” Nuttall says. The owners didn’t need a shed. “They’re not big gardeners, so the storage in the outdoor kitchen and the garage at the front of the house is enough,” Nuttall says.Fragrant climbing plants growing up the pergola gently scent the area. At the back, evergreen pleached oleaster (Elaeagnus x ebbingei ‘Compacta’, zones 7 to 9) trees, which have leaves with pretty silvery undersides, create privacy while leaving the lovely texture of the original brick wall on display.How to Renovate a Small BackyardNatasha Nuttall Garden DesignSave PhotoPale green baby’s tears (Soleirolia soleirolii, zones 9 to 11) adds a velvety note to the hardscape.Before PhotoSarah AlcroftSave PhotoBefore: The landscape was lower than the house, so Nuttall had to raise it to create an easy transition between indoors and out. “The owners didn’t want any steps,” she says.This also helped with another problem. “The roots of the big cherry tree next door were coming up through the lawn, so we put root barrier around all the hard landscaped areas,” she says. She then raised the yard above them to align with the back of the house. The grading work meant extra material had to be brought into the yard. “There’s a void under the deck near the house, though, so there wasn’t too much area that needed to be built up,” the designer says. “And luckily, there’s a side entrance!”Natasha Nuttall Garden DesignSave PhotoAfter: The boundary in front of the cherry tree now has a kitchen running along it. The new fence is painted dark gray. “The owners like dark colors — the back doors are black, so we used those as inspiration,” Nuttall says.She chose gray decking boards and tiles. The owners wanted low-maintenance materials, so she used porcelain and composite decking.The cooker is a Kamado Joe grill. “The husband was really keen on having one, and they use it a lot, even in winter,” Nuttall says. To fit in the large appliance, she designed the kitchen cabinets to be deeper than usual.Charcoal DesignBoard composite decking; Slab Coke porcelain paving, both by London StoneWhat to Know About Adding an Outdoor KitchenNatasha Nuttall Garden DesignSave PhotoThe landscape now feels very much part of the house, as this view from the back room shows. The dining table can be extended, which is perfect for the family members — who like to entertain and, since the pandemic, sometimes work in the yard.Three tree ferns (there’s a third one at the far end of the kitchen) make nice architectural features in the landscape and lead the eye through the space. “Tree ferns usually stay green throughout winter in London, though this year they’ve suffered with the prolonged cold patches, and some leaves have gone brown,” Nuttall says. “But it doesn’t matter, as in spring the new leaves will unfold and the old ones can be cut off.”Shop for outdoor furniture on HouzzNatasha Nuttall Garden DesignSave PhotoNuttall included lots of evergreen plants. “Even though the design makes it look bigger, the actual space isn’t huge, so I wanted to fill it with things that had a presence most of the year,” she says. “Some things go below ground, and there are lots of bulbs, but there are also a lot of things that are leafy year-round.”The purple-leaved plant seen here is ‘Royal Purple’ smoke bush (Cotinus coggygria ‘Royal Purple’, zones 4 to 8), which can be cut back hard each year or two in order to maintain the desired size and shape.Other plants include saxifrage (Saxifraga x geum ‘Dentata’, zones 6 to 9), ‘Blackthorn’ burnet (Sanguisorba ‘Blackthorn’, zones 4 to 9), masterwort (Astrantia sp.), hydrangea and sage (Salvia x jamensis, zones 7 to 9). The little tree in the middle distance is Japanese snowbell tree (Styrax japonicus ‘Snowcone’, zones 5 to 9).Natasha Nuttall Garden DesignSave PhotoNuttall had to take into account the fact that a landscape like this has lots of shady spots. “The sun does move around, but I’ve gone for a lot of shade-tolerant plants, as some areas don’t get very much light,” she says.She took advantage of the borrowed landscape in the form of trees in a neighboring yard by planting climbers by the fences. The star jasmine (Trachelospermum jasminoides, zones 8 to 10) seen here, for instance, already visually connects with the tree behind and blurs the boundary.A range of colors from greens to reddish purple flows beautifully down the garden. “It’s kind of like a tapestry,” Nuttall says. “Although I love flowering plants and try to get them in, really what you’re going to be seeing most of the time is the different textures and colors of foliage, and that gives a lovely layered tapestry of planting that makes it look really lush, even in the winter.”Natasha Nuttall Garden DesignSave PhotoThe landscape has a watering system that delivers water to the roots. “We set it to come on either late at night or very early morning, so the water doesn’t just evaporate,” Nuttall says.The lighting is wired in. “It’s just for atmosphere really — it doesn’t light up the whole garden,” she says.Unsurprisingly, the owners love their new leafy, sociable yard, calling it “an all-year-round delight.”More

But all of the threats and demands animals face don't just go away when it's time to doze.

Masako Tamaki explores how animals' brains remain vigilant even at their most vulnerable.

First of all, they wanted more living space, including a new kitchen and mudroom. Second, Stefan was drawn to the challenge of building something circular. And third, who can resist a turret’s fairy-tale-like allure? So when the pandemic hit, they took advantage of the lull in Stefan’s business and went for it, enlisting Bethany Adams to design the new interior spaces. Here’s how Adams made the kitchen feel at once updated and timeless, with the turret an integral part of its function and charm.Bethany Adams InteriorsSave PhotoPhotos by J.L. Jordan PhotographyKitchen at a GlanceWho lives here: Stefan Rumancik of Designer Builders; his wife, Heather; and their daughterLocation: Louisville, KentuckySize: 323 square feet (30 square meters)Designer: Bethany Adams of Bethany Adams InteriorsThe house is in Audubon Park, a leafy city within Louisville. It’s known in part for its well-preserved early-20th-century architecture, including Craftsman and Dutch Colonial Revival homes like the Rumanciks’.The couple wanted the addition to look seamless with their home’s original architecture, with updated finishes and fixtures that reflect the natural materials and hand-craftsmanship prevalent in the 1930s. Stefan’s frequent collaborator Mark Foxworth of Foxworth Architecture handled the exterior architectural design. Stefan had renovated Adams’ kitchen two years prior and was impressed by her work, so she was a clear choice for the interior design.The kitchen, seen here from the perspective of a small hallway, is part of the new three-level addition at the rear of the house.

The island and overlay Shaker-style cabinets were the last project of Stefan’s longtime cabinetmaker before retiring, Adams says. The homeowners chose the navy color for the cabinets, which Adams paired with walnut accents.“Anytime I’m doing a two-tone situation — in this case, the blue and the walnut — I always try to pull it across the room so that it’s not just one element,” Adams says. “So here the wood is on the island, but it’s also on the hood in the upper cabinets. And then it’s not walnut in the windows, but it’s stained to match the wood. And so your eye sort of travels around back and forth.” Learn about remodelingBethany Adams InteriorsSave PhotoHere, design assistant Liza Galler stands at the sink looking out at the backyard. The countertop is Platinum quartzite peppered with a little bit of blue and a lot of gray. The material is natural as well as durable, and the waterfall design on the island protects the beautiful walnut cabinetry.The black Verona range and the stainless steel refrigerator were reused from the existing kitchen.Cabinet paint: Polo Blue, Benjamin MooreBethany Adams InteriorsSave PhotoThe sink color was a happy accident. “We ordered a white sink and then the black one showed up,” Adams says. “We hadn’t even known that was an option and we loved it.”The faucet has a pull-down feature and a handle in knurled brass — an etched texture with a satisfying feel and sophisticated look. The same texture is on the burnished brushed-brass cabinet handles.Faucet: Brizo; cabinet handles: Restoration HardwareNeed a pro for your home remodeling project?Let Houzz find the best pros for youFind ProsBethany Adams InteriorsSave PhotoThe handmade backsplash tile has a ribbed texture and a lot of variation, which makes its single grayish color option, called Lotus, look like multiple colors.The homeowners were adamant about not wanting open shelving, but too much dark color can be overwhelming. So Adams added lightness with inset steel-and-ribbed-glass upper cabinets.Tile: Ribbed field tile in Lotus, Ann Sacks Shop for kitchen appliancesBethany Adams InteriorsSave PhotoLarge windows let sunshine pour in, and there’s ample overhead lighting as well. Commonly, pendant lights are placed over a kitchen island. But here, because the island is already well-illuminated, the ceilings aren’t very tall and the range wall has “a lot going on,” Adams says, she opted to put the pendants in front of the windows instead, to draw the eye in that direction. “It’s also really beautiful from the outside when those lights are on to see them — one, two, three — in the three little windows,” she says.Chartreuse tweed upholstery on the West Elm counter stools adds three pops of complementary color.Pendant lights: Crackle glass and brass, Hudson Valley LightingBethany Adams InteriorsSave PhotoLooking toward the other end of the room, past a glass door leading to the backyard, you can see the interior of the circular turret on the left. (Above the dining nook is a new circular shower in the primary suite.) Though a common feature of Victorian homes, turrets or towers are not typical on Dutch Colonial Revival-style homes. But because this home has a barnlike silhouette, the turret recalls a silo and thus feels fitting, Adams says. Plus, it’s not visible from the street. We’ll look at its function in the kitchen more closely in a moment, but first, note the set of cabinets on the right.Bethany Adams InteriorsSave PhotoThese cabinets form a dry bar tailored to the homeowners, who are bourbon aficionados, Adams says. At the top of the cabinets full of barware are brass grills hiding another surprise.“[The homeowners] are very big into music and had these very specific speakers that they wanted to incorporate. I did not want to see the speakers,” Adams says with a laugh. The grills’ open mesh provided the solution.Bethany Adams InteriorsSave PhotoBack to the turret, which Stefan and Heather had earmarked for a dining nook right from the start. Adding a built-in circular banquette was Adams’ idea — a tricky one to implement but worth it. “Stefan and his lead carpenter built it themselves,” Adams says. “Because the radius is so specific for the banquette, each one of those [upholstered] channels is a separate piece that could come out, and rather than separate window sills for each of the windows in the turret, they just made like one curved window sill. That was like a feat of measuring and engineering, but it turned out beautifully.”Adams used the same bold chartreuse fabric she used on the island stools. She advises a neutral backdrop for big-investment spaces like kitchens, but she likes to make unexpected choices for accent pieces that are easy to redo.“I want this kitchen to last stylistically 25 years at least,” she says. “And so the stools and the banquette, I feel like those are the places to bring in the fun.”Bethany Adams InteriorsSave PhotoStefan made the table for Heather for Christmas using two extra pieces of the quartzite and a strip of walnut down the middle. Adams helped him source the gold powder-coated steel base on Etsy.The West Elm chandelier is perforated brass, which complements the knurled brass of the kitchen hardware.Bethany Adams InteriorsSave PhotoIf you look back at the first photo, you’ll see an arched entrance to the kitchen from a small hallway or vestibule. This arched entry to the new mudroom is off the same hallway. The shape mimics two existing arches at the front of the house and another arch leading from the kitchen into the dining room. That repetition helps the new addition feel seamless with the original architecture. Bethany Adams InteriorsSave PhotoThe mudroom is where the old kitchen was, so the family used to enter straight into the kitchen from the home’s back entrance — not ideal when it came to keeping the mess from boots and backpacks at bay. “Now they say the mudroom is their favorite room in the house for obvious reasons: He works in construction and, you know, [their daughter is] 11!” Adams says with a laugh. The floor is durable, easy-to-clean tile that resembles brick. The cabinetry matches the kitchen’s but with leather-and-brass pulls. Adams installed open cubbies for day-to-day use and, next to them, a closet for storage of out-of-season coats.Bethany Adams InteriorsSave PhotoThe tile continues into a small powder room that’s behind the door in the left foreground of the previous photo. It replaced a small bathroom that was roughly where the hallway is now.Curved brushed brass cabinet pulls on the walnut vanity and a round leather-and-brass mirror echo the turret’s geometry. Adams topped the vanity with strongly veined Fantasy Brown stone. “There’s a beauty to natural stone that can’t be replicated no matter how hard you try,” she says.Wallpaper: Woods, Cole & Son; sconces, Hudson Valley LightingSuzanne EnnisSave PhotoThe new floor plan with the kitchen and turret additionSince the project wrapped up, Adams and Stefan have been working together “all the time,” Adams says. Asked if she’d do anything differently now, she pauses for a moment. “No, I don’t think so,” she says. “I think it turned out really, really well.”More on HouzzRead more kitchen storiesBrowse kitchen

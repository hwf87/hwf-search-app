166621311,5 Bold New Powder Rooms,See how designers used playful pattern and bright color to elevate the look and wow guests in these small bathrooms,Mitchell Parker,https://www.houzz.com/magazine/5-bold-new-powder-rooms-stsetivw-vs~166621311,"Using bold color and pattern in a powder room is a favorite design tactic for many home professionals. That’s because a lot of homeowners are more open to the idea of creating a small space that surprises guests with a dramatic departure in style from the rest of the home. Here, designers share the details they used to create punched-up powder rooms. Erika Jayne Design BuildSave Photo1. Playful PatternDesigner: Erika Chaudhuri of Erika Jayne Design BuildLocation: Chevy Chase, MarylandSize: 40 square feet (3.7 square meters); 5 by 8 feetHomeowners’ request. “This rare 1920s Spanish-style home had been stripped of character and charm by the previous homeowner,” designer Erika Chaudhuri says. “The clients are working to slowly return the home to its original glory with contemporary sensibility. This bathroom needed to transform into a fun, Spanish-inspired, functional space for daily use.”Chaudhuri uses Houzz Pro business software for all of her proposals, invoices and design selections through the Room Boards feature. Main feature. “The key goal was creating visual interest while utilizing durable materials,” Chaudhuri says. “In order to honor the Spanish style of the home, bold-patterned ceramic tile with a traditional encaustic look was installed to create a focal wall behind the vanity and new floating shelves. Warm red ceramic penny tiles accented by dark brown grout creates an easy-to-maintain yet bold flooring.  A carved wood vanity and warm wood shelves bring both visual and physical texture to the space.”Other special features. Satin brass fixtures with matte black accessories. Natural woven-fiber storage baskets and accents. Designer tip. “Small spaces don’t need to be boring,” Chaudhuri says. “Small bathrooms are a great chance to implement bold colors and patterns. Embrace the heritage of your home to guide your choice of pattern and color palette.”“Uh-oh” moment. “Supply chain issues continue to be unpredictable, even with the most careful planning,” Chaudhuri says. “Due to quick changes in availability, we needed to quickly pivot to a different — yet equally gorgeous — patterned tile for the accent wall. The penny tile also presented supply problems. This particular color and price point was hard to replicate with another option. Luckily, by the time we had settled on another option, our original choice was back in stock.”Find a bathroom designer near youà la carte DESIGNSave Photo2. Rustic RichnessDesigner: Jeane Dole of à la carte DesignLocation: DenverSize: 36 square feet (3.3 square meters)Homeowners’ request. “A powder room may be the most publicly visible room in anybody’s home,” designer Jeane Dole says. “The homeowners are in it constantly and virtually every visitor to the home is likely to use this space. This powder room was super basic — make that boring — and not arranged in a convenient manner at all. The vanity was directly in front of you as you entered, which is fine, but the toilet was immediately on your right, which made it very tight near the door. There was no good reason for this arrangement and there was plenty of space to position the toilet on the same wall as the vanity, so that’s what I recommended. Now you enter the room and everything is beautifully arranged on the same wall. Beyond this request, the clients left it to me to identify finishes that would complement their semi-rustic style.”Main feature. “In any room, one must consider the view as you enter,” Dole says. “With the new layout, the view is all laid out in front of you with a full-height tiled feature behind another feature, the custom-built vanity. The wall sconce [not shown] and metal mirror round out the simple yet rustic feel the client was looking for.”Other special features. “The extra-thick countertop and the gooseneck oil-rubbed bronze faucet add to the rustic charm of this powder room,” Dole says. “Then, the use of a burnt orange on all the other walls brings the rustic into today, providing some great contrast to what otherwise is a pretty neutral palette.”Shop from a curated collection of popular bathroom vanitiesThe Sitting RoomSave Photo3. Berry BurstDesigner: Megan Jackson Meder of The Sitting RoomLocation: Deephaven, Minnesota Size: 33 square feet (3.1 square meters); 5 feet, 2 inches by 6 feet, 4 inchesHomeowners’ request. “The clients wanted a modern and dramatic introduction to their home for their guests,” says designer Megan Jackson Meder, who used Houzz ideabooks to coordinate inspiration ideas with her clients. Main feature. “We debated between a wallpaper or tile and ultimately fell so in love with this tile we decided to put it on all of the walls,” Jackson Meder says. “They love bold colors, so we went with a deep berry paint for the floating wall vanity.”Other special features. Brass sconce and mirror. Designer tip. “Be bold in your powder room,” Jackson Meder says. “It’s mainly for guests, so have fun with it and show off your personality.”Tile: Nova, 12 by 24 inches, Emser Tile; sconce: Jewett, Hudson Valley Lighting; vanity paint: Mulberry in high-gloss, Benjamin MooreTimeless Design by Kate FitzGerald-WilksSave Photo4. Brass-and-Blue BeautyDesigner: Kate FitzGerald-Wilks of Timeless DesignLocation: Hockessin, DelawareSize: 32½  square feet (3 square meters); 5 by 6½ feet Homeowner’s request. “After designing and renovating this client’s entire first floor, including the kitchen, pantry, living room, dining room and study, she decided the powder room was no longer up to snuff,” designer Kate FitzGerald-Wilks says. “We kept the color scheme consistent and sourced really special pieces and finishes that are sure to wow her guests.” Main feature. “Our client fell in love with this wallpaper when we originally presented it to her for her study, but she ultimately decided against wallpaper for that space,” FitzGerald-Wilks says. “We decided the powder room was the perfect place to show it off and built the rest of the space around it.”Other special features. Custom wainscoting. Blue vanity. Gold hardware, plumbing fixtures, lighting and mirror. “In a small space like a powder room, we feel it’s important that every element be special but not overwhelming,” FitzGerald-Wilks says. Designer tip. “Are you afraid of integrating bold pattern into your home? A powder room is a great space to add a commanding pattern or color,” FitzGerald-Wilks says. “It’s a large statement but on a smaller scale, and because you’ll only spend a few minutes at a time in the space, it won’t feel overwhelming.”“Uh-oh” moment. “Believe it or not, our biggest challenge in this tiny room came from an existing outlet placement,” FitzGerald-Wilks says. “We met with our master carpenter as we were hashing out the final height on the wainscot installation and discovered the outlet to be in just the wrong spot to accommodate our ideal height. The client was not keen on the idea of moving the outlet, so after reflecting on the challenge, I determined the outlet and its plate could be rotated 90 degrees, and with minimal repair our wainscot could go in at just the right height.”Wallpaper: Mulberry Tree in navy, Thibaut; vanity: Thornton in Bright Navy and Carrara, 30 inches, Signature Hardware; mirror Haya Scalloped in gold, Uttermost; light fixture: Broche in antique gold, Crystorama LightingNew to home remodeling?

165644553,Bathroom of the Week: Bold Midcentury Style in 70 Square Feet,"A designer updates a dated pink-and-floral bathroom with a walnut vanity, geometric tile and a frameless glass shower",Jeannie Matteucci,https://www.houzz.com/magazine/bathroom-of-the-week-bold-midcentury-style-in-70-square-feet-stsetivw-vs~165644553,"This young Oregon couple wanted to make the only bathroom on the main floor of their 1950s ranch-style home welcoming and functional for them and their three kids. That meant replacing an abundance of floral wallpaper and pink tile with a fresh new look and opening up a cramped shower-tub combo enclosed by frosted glass.For help transforming the dated space, they hired designer Natalie Pozzesi. They realized the shower-tub concept wasn’t working and decided to ditch the tub for a more spacious frameless glass shower with a handheld wand that gives the kids something easy to use. That decision allowed for a larger custom rift-sawn walnut double vanity that improves on storage and style. And speaking of style, bright blue tile in a geometric pattern spans an entire wall, punching up the design with a midcentury look that nods to the era of the home. Before PhotoThayer Design BuildSave Photo“After” photos by Realiant PhotographyBathroom at a GlanceWho lives here: A young couple with three kidsLocation: Corvallis, OregonSize: 70 square feet (6.5 square meters)Designer: Natalie Pozzesi of Thayer Design BuildBefore: Although the family has a full bathroom in a finished basement, this bathroom is the only one on the main floor. In the former space, shown here, shabby pink tile, floral wallpaper and inadequate lighting made for a busy and drab look. The wallpaper was peeling in some spots, and the doors and drawers on the worn wood vanity didn’t work properly. Plus, for this family of five, a single sink wasn’t cutting it. And the enclosed shower-tub combo was a pain to use. “Bathing kids in that tub made it really difficult,” Pozzesi says. “It was hard to reach in and get in and out of the tub.”Thayer Design BuildSave PhotoAfter: Pozzesi took the bathroom down to the studs and replaced the shower-tub combo with a spacious low-curb shower with a frameless glass enclosure that gives the layout some breathing room. This move also freed up space for the new double vanity in rift-sawn walnut with slab fronts, a nod to midcentury modern style.“Walnut was sticking with the midcentury theme and era-appropriate,” Pozzesi says. “We also wanted to bring in some contrast since the homeowners knew they wanted white countertops and other white elements.”Pozzesi placed cabinets beneath each sink and, below those, a drawer. “Normally when you do a drawer under a sink, it’s usually just a false panel,” Pozzesi says. “By reconfiguring it this way, it gives them more storage and the drawers are also in reach for the kids.”Spanning the entire vanity wall and into the shower is 8-inch blue hexagonal porcelain tile with a geometric pattern. “We originally knew we wanted to do some type of geometric tile,” Pozzesi says. “We started out with something pretty plain, but it felt sterile. This pattern stuck with the midcentury theme but also modernized it.”Elsewhere, glossy white 3-by-12-inch ceramic tiles in a herringbone pattern add a subtle design and help enhance light from a new vanity light and recessed ceiling lights. “Those tiles specifically have some texture to them, so they’re not completely flat,” Pozzesi says. “The herringbone pattern adds interest and gives some direction to the wall.”Cabinet pulls: Jute bar pull in Brushed, Kohler; vanity light: LED Bath Bar in brushed nickel, Kichler Find a bathroom designer near youThayer Design BuildSave PhotoBrushed nickel faucets coordinate with other brushed nickel finishes in the room. Blue-gray wall paint (Passive by Sherwin-Williams) complements the blue wall tile. The marble-look quartz countertop is an easy-to-maintain surface that works with the design approach. “We wanted something in keeping with the midcentury look,” Pozzesi says. “It’s very common in midcentury to have a white top. We didn’t want anything to overshadow the geometric tile, and wanted just a bit of movement there.”A custom medicine cabinet features interior wood shelves and two electrical outlets.

The shower features a rain head mounted in the ceiling and a hand-held shower head on the wall, both in a brushed nickel finish. “The hand shower you see on the wall is adjustable,” Pozzesi says. “I think they realized they were giving up a tub and wanted something that was adjustable for the kids. The overhead shower gives them that luxury feel.”The shower also includes a portable teak bench and a niche for products, backed in the same glossy white tile in a herringbone pattern. “On the top part of the niche we routed in an LED strip light that highlights the movement in that herringbone tile nicely,” Pozzesi says.Shower fixtures: Cia, MoenThayer Design BuildSave PhotoAn LED light strip under the vanity gives the cabinet a floating effect. “We wanted that luxury bathroom feel, and it also doubles as a nightlight for the kids,” Pozzesi says.The heated bathroom floor is 12-by-24-inch gray wood-look porcelain tile. “We wanted to play off the other colors and have the floor be neutral and not distract from the other details,” Pozzesi says. The device you see on the wall by the window is the electronic control for the floor heat.Before PhotoThayer Design BuildSave PhotoBefore: This photo taken from inside the former shower-tub combo shows the toilet area across from the vanity.

64047990,Your Spring Organizing Checklist,Use these ideas for clearing out the clutter and keeping rooms neat and tidy,Laura Gaskill,https://www.houzz.com/magazine/your-spring-organizing-checklist-stsetivw-vs~64047990,"Spring cleaning may get more of the hype, but I would argue that spring organizing is even more important. When your belongings are neat and tidy, your whole home feels cleaner and more inviting, and daily life is easier and more pleasant. If you’ve got the spring-cleaning bug, don’t stop there. Take advantage of your motivation and devote a weekend (or two) to clearing out clutter and getting organized all around the house. SGDI - Sarah Gallop Design Inc.Save PhotoEntrywayClear out any lingering winter boots and mittens, unread stacks of mail and anything else that doesn’t belong.Add enough hooks, shelves and baskets to hold your belongings when you come in the door.If you have a drawer near your entrance, place a drawer organizer inside to keep small items neat, and be sure to have a recycling bin within reach for tossing junk mail.10 Times to Hire a Professional OrganizerCoppice GuildSave PhotoKitchenMove the hardest-working tools (wooden spoons, tongs) front and center, and get rid of seldom-used single-purpose tools.Reshuffle your cabinet contents to move less frequently used items and entertaining supplies to the highest shelves and least-accessible areas, and your everyday basics within easy reach.Find a casserole dish that belongs to a friend? Aunt Sally’s serving spoons? Make a pile of to-return items and bring it to your car.LindalsköketSave PhotoTip: Make a morning cupboard. If your mornings tend to be rushed, consider carving out a nook in a cupboard where you can keep all your morning necessities together. A shelf or two can hold coffee- and tea-making supplies and breakfast favorites, as well as lunch containers if you pack a lunch, for either yourself or your children. Find coffee and tea products in the Houzz Shop Advance Design Studio, Ltd.Save PhotoLaundry RoomRecycle old, empty containers, and ditch any laundry products you don’t like, to make some space. Decanting laundry supplies into other containers is not necessary to create a lovely, organized space — just corral the assorted containers on a tray or in a bin. This serves the double purpose of looking nice and making it easier to move everything aside to clean.Add a triple-sorter laundry basket to help avoid the dreaded laundry-room-floor pileup. Give each family member an individual basket so you can keep clothes separated, making it easier to sort afterward.Shop for baskets Shira Gill| | Organization and StylingSave PhotoLinen ClosetIf you’ve been accumulating bedding and towels for years without getting rid of old sets, chances are you have more than you need. Two or three sets of sheets per bed, and two sets of towels per person (more if you have swimmers in the house), plus an extra set for guests, are generally plenty. Choose the best and donate the rest — and if your old linens are in bad shape, drop them in a textile recycling bin rather than the trash.Tip: Keep piles of towels and sheets from toppling over by using a shelf divider and tucking each set of sheets inside a pillowcase. Store small items  inside labeled storage boxes.Shelter ResidentialSave PhotoBedroomYour bedroom should be a peaceful haven devoted to rest. But often the bedroom ends up being a repository for piles of laundry and clutter — not the makings of a good night’s sleep! Sort through your clothes, setting aside a pile to give away, and neatly fold and put away the rest.Remove old coffee cups and water glasses, papers and any other junk that doesn’t belong in your bedroom.Peek under the bed. Neat underbed storage boxes can be helpful if they’re filled with things you honestly need, use or love. Just don’t let under your bed become a hiding spot for items you should give away or sell.Find a professional organizer near youSuzi Appel PhotographySave PhotoBathMuch of the clutter in the bathroom comes from products tried and not liked. These unloved items end up getting shoved to the back of the cupboard, where they take up precious space and gather dust. Ruthlessly sort through your bath and beauty products. Toss out everything you do not use, and recycle the containers if possible. Once everything is cleared out, choose one or two baskets or trays to keep the products you use daily neatly contained.If you have been storing medications in the bathroom, move them to a different location — the humidity can be damaging. Choose a place that is cool, dry and out of reach of children.Save PhotoBooksThe first edit of your book collection should be books you bought (or were given) that you didn’t end up liking very much. Next, consider pulling out any books you enjoyed but realistically will not pick up again. If you have specific friends you think would love certain books, put these in a tote bag and put them in your car — better to actually pass them along than to just think about it! Donate unwanted books to a local library or Goodwill, or, if you want to make a little extra cash, take them to a local used-book seller.Farrow & BallSave PhotoPapers and Printed PhotosWalk through your house and gather up all of the random, unsorted piles of paper you can find, making one stack. Go through this stack with a recycling bin and shredder until it’s all gone. Put upcoming events on your calendar, file important records and pay bills as needed. To quickly handle a big pile of printed photos, sort them roughly by date and file them in photo boxes.Tip: If traditional filing cabinets just aren’t working for you, consider switching to a more flexible (and portable) system consisting of small file boxes or expanding files. The beauty in using file boxes is that they take up only as much space as you need, and you can keep one small box near the entry for easily (and quickly) filing important papers.Simplifying: Which Papers to Keep and Which to TossJessica Risko Smith Interior DesignSave PhotoTech Devices and Digital PhotosErase your data from old devices, then drop them in a cell phone recycling bin or return them to your cell-service provider for a credit. Back up your current computer and other devices to an external hard drive, as well as a cloud-based service for extra security. Order a photo book or prints from last year’s digital photos, and create a simple plan for organizing digital photos in the future. Keep them in files labeled with the month, and tag your favorites so you can easily gather them into a book or an album when the time comes.Tip: Whenever you get a promotional email you do not want to receive, scroll down to the bottom and click “unsubscribe” before deleting. Cutting back on unnecessary marketing emails will save you time in the long run — and might save you money as well, as you are not reminded of things to buy!How to Organize Your Digital PhotosLeroy Merlin OFFICIELSave PhotoGarden Tools and Supplies Toss out worn-out gloves and long-expired seed packets, and recycle empty packaging. Use wall-mounted grips to store long-handled tools, and stash short-handled gardening tools point-down in a bucket of sand. Tools should be stored out of the elements, so if you don’t have a garage or storage shed, consider investing in a small outdoor storage cabinet where you can keep these items safely protected.Share: What organizing projects are you working on?

The majority of homeowners who responded to our survey remodeled or decorated their home in 2022, and plan to remain in their home for 11 years or more following the renovation. More than half also are planning home projects in the coming year. “Faced with shortages of housing stock and high interest rates, we’re seeing homeowners update their current home to make the space more functional for the long term,” says Liza Hausman, vice president of industry marketing at Houzz. “We’re also seeing an uptick in additions, with the vast majority of homeowners hiring professionals to achieve their goals.”In addition to showing new highs for renovation activity, the report also shares that spending is on the rise and kitchens and bathrooms are getting larger. See more about those findings and other home remodeling and decorating trends from the new study below. Save Photo1. Renovation Activity ContinuesThe majority of homeowners (58%) tackled a renovation project in 2022. Plus, more homeowners decorated in 2022 (57%) than in 2021 (55%). And the share of homeowners who made home repairs (48%) and built new homes (5%) also rose 2 points each year over year.Save PhotoMeanwhile, the median spend continues to increase too. The national median renovation spend per household increased from $18,000 in 2021 to $22,000 in 2022.For homeowners with a larger budget (the top 10% of spend), the spend rose from $100,000 in 2021 to $140,000 or more in 2022. Keep in mind that the median spend throughout the study is not adjusted for inflation. Also keep in mind that the median means that half of the people spent more and half spent less; it’s not the average. Economists like to reference the median, or midpoint, figure rather than the average because the average can be skewed, can be volatile year over year and can be misleadingly high or low because of a single project that costs far more or less than others.The study gathered these median spending costs and other details from more than 46,000 homeowners who responded to survey questions.

Plans to Renovate Also ContinueMany homeowners have future home projects in mind. More than half (55%) plan to renovate in 2023. And nearly half (48%) have decorating projects on the horizon, as well as home repairs (35%) and homebuilding projects (3%).The median planned spend on 2023 renovations is $15,000, the same as it was in 2022. Homeowners with higher-budget projects (the top 10% of spend) plan to spend $85,000 in 2023, up $10,000 (from $75,000) in 2022.But it’s worth pointing out that many home remodeling and design professionals expect slowed growth in 2023, following strong years in 2022 and 2021, according to the 2023 Houzz U.S. State of the Industry report.Shop for furniture and other products for your homeFlourish Interiors by Vanessa C SmithSave PhotoSave Photo3.

Homeowners Rely on Diverse Funding MethodsWhen it comes to paying for a home project, cash from savings remains by far the most common funding source (82%). But homeowners do tap into a variety of sources. The share of those who secured a home loan in 2022 to tackle a home project ticked up slightly, going from 14% in 2021 to to 16% in 2022.Cash from a home sale is steadily growing in popularity as a funding source — 13% used this source in 2022, compared with 11% in 2021 and 9% in 2020.Credit cards, on the other hand, are becoming less popular. The share of homeowners using credit cards to fund home projects dropped 10 points year over year, to 28% in 2022.Baran Studio ArchitectureSave PhotoSave Photo5. Motivation of Selling Declines in PopularityNearly 3 in 5 homeowners (61%) plan to stay in their home for 11 years or more following a 2022 renovation. And the share of homeowners tackling a remodel with a plan to soon sell their home has steadily declined since 2018. Only 6% of renovating homeowners cited selling their home as a motivation to renovate in 2022, compared with 9% in 2021 and 12% in 2018.The top two reasons homeowners tackled a home project in 2022 were finally having the time and finally having the financial means, both at 37%.Sho & Co.Save PhotoSave Photo6.

One in 10 homeowners expanded a living space with an add-on in 2022, compared with 8% each year from 2018 through 2021. The average number of addition projects undertaken also has increased, from fewer than three in both 2020 and 2021 to more than three in 2022.Consistent with previous years, interior spaces are the most popular to renovate (72%), and homeowners tackle an average of nearly three interior projects at a time.

More homeowners in 2022 expanded these spaces with additions than in the previous year.While the median spend for renovations of several types of interior rooms rose in 2022, the increase is especially notable for home office remodels.

166605562,Yard of the Week: Lush Plantings Surround Cozy Seating Areas,"A designer transforms a long, narrow yard into an outdoor oasis with layers of soft plants and inviting nooks",Sarah Alcroft,https://www.houzz.com/magazine/yard-of-the-week-lush-plantings-surround-cozy-seating-areas-stsetivw-vs~166605562,"Having a meal at a leafy rooftop restaurant in East London one day, the owners of this 1980s house fell for the relaxed mood of the casual seating areas and decked walkways amid grasses and climbers, and decided they’d love that look in their garden. So they contacted designer Natasha Nuttall to help them turn their neglected patch into a serene space where they could enjoy being outdoors and entertain with ease. Undeterred by the tight dimensions of the plot, Nuttall cleverly fitted in a lounge area, a dining table, a casual seating spot and an outdoor kitchen, all softened and partially hidden by lush plantings.Natasha Nuttall Garden DesignSave PhotoPhotos by Eleanor WalpoleYard at a GlanceWho lives here: A couple with two teenage daughtersLocation: East LondonSize: 701 square feet (65 square meters); 16½ by 42½ feet (5 by 13 meters)Landscape designer: Natasha Nuttall Garden DesignThe owners aren’t avid gardeners, but they wanted an easy-to-maintain leafy retreat where they could hang out almost year-round with their daughters and entertain friends.Find a local landscape designerBefore PhotoSarah AlcroftSave PhotoBefore: The plot they inherited wasn’t doing the job. “It was basically a lawn that was failing and a rickety old patio, and the fence was falling down,” Nuttall says. You can see from this photo how narrow the space is. Nuttall had to plan carefully to fit in all the elements the owners requested.New to home remodeling? Learn the basicsNatasha Nuttall Garden DesignSave PhotoAfter: Nuttall’s trick to slotting so much into the yard was to soften the paving and boundaries with plants. “They’re not huge beds, but I tried to fit in as much as possible and plant quite densely,” she says. “I made sure the planting spilled over the edges to soften the hard landscaped areas.”She explains that dense plantings also help to expand a space, because they create a bit of mystery; as you walk through the landscape, different areas are revealed.At the corner of this bed by the rear patio is dwarf Japanese mock orange (Pittosporum tobira ‘Nanum’, USDA zones 9 to 10; find your zone), which, Nuttall says, “adds shape but isn’t too formal or fast-growing.” There are also ‘Starlight’ Chinese silver grass (Miscanthus sinensis ‘Starlight’, zones 5 to 9) and  evergreen golden sweet flag (Acorus gramineus ‘Ogon’, zones 5 to 9), adding height, softness and movement to the beds.Note: Some species of Miscanthus can self-seed and be considered invasive, depending on the locale and the site’s conditions. Check with your local nursery before planting.Natasha Nuttall Garden DesignSave PhotoThe seating area at the back of the yard can accommodate a crowd. A pergola provides shade for summer days, while a fire pit (just visible on the far left) keeps the area usable in cooler seasons.There’s summer storage under a lift-up lid within the right-hand section of the bench; in the winter, the cushions are stored indoors. “The ‘floating’ section [of the bench] is underplanted, and there’s a light under there, which looks really nice in the evening,” Nuttall says. The owners didn’t need a shed. “They’re not big gardeners, so the storage in the outdoor kitchen and the garage at the front of the house is enough,” Nuttall says.Fragrant climbing plants growing up the pergola gently scent the area. At the back, evergreen pleached oleaster (Elaeagnus x ebbingei ‘Compacta’, zones 7 to 9) trees, which have leaves with pretty silvery undersides, create privacy while leaving the lovely texture of the original brick wall on display.How to Renovate a Small BackyardNatasha Nuttall Garden DesignSave PhotoPale green baby’s tears (Soleirolia soleirolii, zones 9 to 11) adds a velvety note to the hardscape.Before PhotoSarah AlcroftSave PhotoBefore: The landscape was lower than the house, so Nuttall had to raise it to create an easy transition between indoors and out. “The owners didn’t want any steps,” she says.This also helped with another problem. “The roots of the big cherry tree next door were coming up through the lawn, so we put root barrier around all the hard landscaped areas,” she says. She then raised the yard above them to align with the back of the house. The grading work meant extra material had to be brought into the yard. “There’s a void under the deck near the house, though, so there wasn’t too much area that needed to be built up,” the designer says. “And luckily, there’s a side entrance!”Natasha Nuttall Garden DesignSave PhotoAfter: The boundary in front of the cherry tree now has a kitchen running along it. The new fence is painted dark gray. “The owners like dark colors — the back doors are black, so we used those as inspiration,” Nuttall says.She chose gray decking boards and tiles. The owners wanted low-maintenance materials, so she used porcelain and composite decking.The cooker is a Kamado Joe grill. “The husband was really keen on having one, and they use it a lot, even in winter,” Nuttall says. To fit in the large appliance, she designed the kitchen cabinets to be deeper than usual.Charcoal DesignBoard composite decking; Slab Coke porcelain paving, both by London StoneWhat to Know About Adding an Outdoor KitchenNatasha Nuttall Garden DesignSave PhotoThe landscape now feels very much part of the house, as this view from the back room shows. The dining table can be extended, which is perfect for the family members — who like to entertain and, since the pandemic, sometimes work in the yard.Three tree ferns (there’s a third one at the far end of the kitchen) make nice architectural features in the landscape and lead the eye through the space. “Tree ferns usually stay green throughout winter in London, though this year they’ve suffered with the prolonged cold patches, and some leaves have gone brown,” Nuttall says. “But it doesn’t matter, as in spring the new leaves will unfold and the old ones can be cut off.”Shop for outdoor furniture on HouzzNatasha Nuttall Garden DesignSave PhotoNuttall included lots of evergreen plants. “Even though the design makes it look bigger, the actual space isn’t huge, so I wanted to fill it with things that had a presence most of the year,” she says. “Some things go below ground, and there are lots of bulbs, but there are also a lot of things that are leafy year-round.”The purple-leaved plant seen here is ‘Royal Purple’ smoke bush (Cotinus coggygria ‘Royal Purple’, zones 4 to 8), which can be cut back hard each year or two in order to maintain the desired size and shape.Other plants include saxifrage (Saxifraga x geum ‘Dentata’, zones 6 to 9), ‘Blackthorn’ burnet (Sanguisorba ‘Blackthorn’, zones 4 to 9), masterwort (Astrantia sp.), hydrangea and sage (Salvia x jamensis, zones 7 to 9). The little tree in the middle distance is Japanese snowbell tree (Styrax japonicus ‘Snowcone’, zones 5 to 9).Natasha Nuttall Garden DesignSave PhotoNuttall had to take into account the fact that a landscape like this has lots of shady spots. “The sun does move around, but I’ve gone for a lot of shade-tolerant plants, as some areas don’t get very much light,” she says.She took advantage of the borrowed landscape in the form of trees in a neighboring yard by planting climbers by the fences. The star jasmine (Trachelospermum jasminoides, zones 8 to 10) seen here, for instance, already visually connects with the tree behind and blurs the boundary.A range of colors from greens to reddish purple flows beautifully down the garden. “It’s kind of like a tapestry,” Nuttall says. “Although I love flowering plants and try to get them in, really what you’re going to be seeing most of the time is the different textures and colors of foliage, and that gives a lovely layered tapestry of planting that makes it look really lush, even in the winter.”Natasha Nuttall Garden DesignSave PhotoThe landscape has a watering system that delivers water to the roots. “We set it to come on either late at night or very early morning, so the water doesn’t just evaporate,” Nuttall says.The lighting is wired in. “It’s just for atmosphere really — it doesn’t light up the whole garden,” she says.Unsurprisingly, the owners love their new leafy, sociable yard, calling it “an all-year-round delight.”More

165919486,"Kitchen of the Week: Walnut, Navy Blue and an Eat-In Turret Too","A 1930s Kentucky home adds a kitchen filled with sumptuous wood, stone, glass and a circular chartreuse banquette",Suzanne Ennis,https://www.houzz.com/magazine/kitchen-of-the-week-walnut-navy-blue-and-an-eat-in-turret-too-stsetivw-vs~165919486,"Builder and general contractor Stefan Rumancik and his wife, Heather, had long played with the idea of expanding and adding a turret to their 1934 house in Louisville, Kentucky. First of all, they wanted more living space, including a new kitchen and mudroom. Second, Stefan was drawn to the challenge of building something circular. And third, who can resist a turret’s fairy-tale-like allure? So when the pandemic hit, they took advantage of the lull in Stefan’s business and went for it, enlisting Bethany Adams to design the new interior spaces. Here’s how Adams made the kitchen feel at once updated and timeless, with the turret an integral part of its function and charm.Bethany Adams InteriorsSave PhotoPhotos by J.L. Jordan PhotographyKitchen at a GlanceWho lives here: Stefan Rumancik of Designer Builders; his wife, Heather; and their daughterLocation: Louisville, KentuckySize: 323 square feet (30 square meters)Designer: Bethany Adams of Bethany Adams InteriorsThe house is in Audubon Park, a leafy city within Louisville. It’s known in part for its well-preserved early-20th-century architecture, including Craftsman and Dutch Colonial Revival homes like the Rumanciks’.The couple wanted the addition to look seamless with their home’s original architecture, with updated finishes and fixtures that reflect the natural materials and hand-craftsmanship prevalent in the 1930s. Stefan’s frequent collaborator Mark Foxworth of Foxworth Architecture handled the exterior architectural design. Stefan had renovated Adams’ kitchen two years prior and was impressed by her work, so she was a clear choice for the interior design.The kitchen, seen here from the perspective of a small hallway, is part of the new three-level addition at the rear of the house. Scroll to the bottom to see the new kitchen floor plan. Hire a kitchen and bath designerBethany Adams InteriorsSave PhotoThe kitchen floors are stained white oak, which were matched to the recently installed oak floors in the rest of the home. The island and overlay Shaker-style cabinets were the last project of Stefan’s longtime cabinetmaker before retiring, Adams says. The homeowners chose the navy color for the cabinets, which Adams paired with walnut accents.“Anytime I’m doing a two-tone situation — in this case, the blue and the walnut — I always try to pull it across the room so that it’s not just one element,” Adams says. “So here the wood is on the island, but it’s also on the hood in the upper cabinets. And then it’s not walnut in the windows, but it’s stained to match the wood. And so your eye sort of travels around back and forth.” Learn about remodelingBethany Adams InteriorsSave PhotoHere, design assistant Liza Galler stands at the sink looking out at the backyard. The countertop is Platinum quartzite peppered with a little bit of blue and a lot of gray. The material is natural as well as durable, and the waterfall design on the island protects the beautiful walnut cabinetry.The black Verona range and the stainless steel refrigerator were reused from the existing kitchen.Cabinet paint: Polo Blue, Benjamin MooreBethany Adams InteriorsSave PhotoThe sink color was a happy accident. “We ordered a white sink and then the black one showed up,” Adams says. “We hadn’t even known that was an option and we loved it.”The faucet has a pull-down feature and a handle in knurled brass — an etched texture with a satisfying feel and sophisticated look. The same texture is on the burnished brushed-brass cabinet handles.Faucet: Brizo; cabinet handles: Restoration HardwareNeed a pro for your home remodeling project?Let Houzz find the best pros for youFind ProsBethany Adams InteriorsSave PhotoThe handmade backsplash tile has a ribbed texture and a lot of variation, which makes its single grayish color option, called Lotus, look like multiple colors.The homeowners were adamant about not wanting open shelving, but too much dark color can be overwhelming. So Adams added lightness with inset steel-and-ribbed-glass upper cabinets.Tile: Ribbed field tile in Lotus, Ann Sacks Shop for kitchen appliancesBethany Adams InteriorsSave PhotoLarge windows let sunshine pour in, and there’s ample overhead lighting as well. Commonly, pendant lights are placed over a kitchen island. But here, because the island is already well-illuminated, the ceilings aren’t very tall and the range wall has “a lot going on,” Adams says, she opted to put the pendants in front of the windows instead, to draw the eye in that direction. “It’s also really beautiful from the outside when those lights are on to see them — one, two, three — in the three little windows,” she says.Chartreuse tweed upholstery on the West Elm counter stools adds three pops of complementary color.Pendant lights: Crackle glass and brass, Hudson Valley LightingBethany Adams InteriorsSave PhotoLooking toward the other end of the room, past a glass door leading to the backyard, you can see the interior of the circular turret on the left. (Above the dining nook is a new circular shower in the primary suite.) Though a common feature of Victorian homes, turrets or towers are not typical on Dutch Colonial Revival-style homes. But because this home has a barnlike silhouette, the turret recalls a silo and thus feels fitting, Adams says. Plus, it’s not visible from the street. We’ll look at its function in the kitchen more closely in a moment, but first, note the set of cabinets on the right.Bethany Adams InteriorsSave PhotoThese cabinets form a dry bar tailored to the homeowners, who are bourbon aficionados, Adams says. At the top of the cabinets full of barware are brass grills hiding another surprise.“[The homeowners] are very big into music and had these very specific speakers that they wanted to incorporate. I did not want to see the speakers,” Adams says with a laugh. The grills’ open mesh provided the solution.Bethany Adams InteriorsSave PhotoBack to the turret, which Stefan and Heather had earmarked for a dining nook right from the start. Adding a built-in circular banquette was Adams’ idea — a tricky one to implement but worth it. “Stefan and his lead carpenter built it themselves,” Adams says. “Because the radius is so specific for the banquette, each one of those [upholstered] channels is a separate piece that could come out, and rather than separate window sills for each of the windows in the turret, they just made like one curved window sill. That was like a feat of measuring and engineering, but it turned out beautifully.”Adams used the same bold chartreuse fabric she used on the island stools. She advises a neutral backdrop for big-investment spaces like kitchens, but she likes to make unexpected choices for accent pieces that are easy to redo.“I want this kitchen to last stylistically 25 years at least,” she says. “And so the stools and the banquette, I feel like those are the places to bring in the fun.”Bethany Adams InteriorsSave PhotoStefan made the table for Heather for Christmas using two extra pieces of the quartzite and a strip of walnut down the middle. Adams helped him source the gold powder-coated steel base on Etsy.The West Elm chandelier is perforated brass, which complements the knurled brass of the kitchen hardware.Bethany Adams InteriorsSave PhotoIf you look back at the first photo, you’ll see an arched entrance to the kitchen from a small hallway or vestibule. This arched entry to the new mudroom is off the same hallway. The shape mimics two existing arches at the front of the house and another arch leading from the kitchen into the dining room. That repetition helps the new addition feel seamless with the original architecture. Bethany Adams InteriorsSave PhotoThe mudroom is where the old kitchen was, so the family used to enter straight into the kitchen from the home’s back entrance — not ideal when it came to keeping the mess from boots and backpacks at bay. “Now they say the mudroom is their favorite room in the house for obvious reasons: He works in construction and, you know, [their daughter is] 11!” Adams says with a laugh. The floor is durable, easy-to-clean tile that resembles brick. The cabinetry matches the kitchen’s but with leather-and-brass pulls. Adams installed open cubbies for day-to-day use and, next to them, a closet for storage of out-of-season coats.Bethany Adams InteriorsSave PhotoThe tile continues into a small powder room that’s behind the door in the left foreground of the previous photo. It replaced a small bathroom that was roughly where the hallway is now.Curved brushed brass cabinet pulls on the walnut vanity and a round leather-and-brass mirror echo the turret’s geometry. Adams topped the vanity with strongly veined Fantasy Brown stone. “There’s a beauty to natural stone that can’t be replicated no matter how hard you try,” she says.Wallpaper: Woods, Cole & Son; sconces, Hudson Valley LightingSuzanne EnnisSave PhotoThe new floor plan with the kitchen and turret additionSince the project wrapped up, Adams and Stefan have been working together “all the time,” Adams says. Asked if she’d do anything differently now, she pauses for a moment. “No, I don’t think so,” she says. “I think it turned out really, really well.”More on HouzzRead more kitchen storiesBrowse kitchen

166362396,12 Ideas From Landscape Pros to Elevate Your Yard’s Design,Learn which elements landscape designers and contractors use to take their projects to the next level,Marianne Lipanovich,https://www.houzz.com/magazine/12-ideas-from-landscape-pros-to-elevate-your-yards-design-stsetivw-vs~166362396,"After you’ve incorporated landscape pros’ must-have features into your yard’s design, you may be looking for ways to make your space stand out even more. We spoke with 10 landscape designers and contractors about their tips for elevating an outdoor space. From simple details to custom features, here are 12 ways  to enhance your landscape.Todd Haiman Landscape DesignSave Photo1. FunctionalityIt’s essential for your landscape design to serve your needs and lifestyle, no matter how beautiful the plants and materials are. “Making a garden beautiful is easy,” New York landscape designer Todd Haiman says. “The hard part is whether it can be functional and beautiful.”Find a landscape designer near you on HouzzBen Scott Garden DesignSave PhotoBen Scott Garden Design2. Signature PlantDefine your garden’s style with a specimen plant or plants. “A signature plant can really create and amplify the landscape,” Chicago landscape designer John Algozzini of Hursthouse says. “It will take the landscape up a notch without breaking the bank.”Algozzini often recommends high-profile specimen trees. “Choose a tree that provides exceptional contrast to the plants around it,” he says. “It will work as the one red umbrella in a sea of gray umbrellas and stand out every time.”LandedSave Photo3. Effective LightingA well-thought-out lighting scheme will allow you to enjoy your outdoor space at night. “It’s sometimes the last thing people think about, but effective landscape lighting provides the right accents, pulls the design together and elevates any outdoor space,” says Kara Gorski  of Landed in Alexandria, Virginia.For Robin Parsons, owner of Spring Greenworks in Kirkland, Washington, lighting also plays an important role in any landscape. “It creates an ambiance that draws people in and truly elevates the outdoor experience,” she says.Blue Sierra Landscape ConstructionSave PhotoBlue Sierra Landscape ConstructionLandscape designer Daren Langhorne of Core Outdoor Living in Clifton, Virginia, places wall lights under benches and counters for subtle lighting that won’t overwhelm the space. “Add three under-capstone lights to a sitting wall, and now you have a great feature at night,” he says.Langhorne recommends choosing low-voltage lights connected to a photosensitive transformer that can automatically turn them on and off. “An often-overlooked advantage of the wall lights is increased security,” he says, referring to how they can help deter unwanted intruders.What to Know About Adding Outdoor LightingHursthouse Landscape Architects and ContractorsSave PhotoHursthouse4. Sculptural ElementAlgozzini also recommends adding a sculptural element to create a singular focal point. “It can thrive on a stand-alone basis in a planting bed, patio or lawn and elevate a landscape design,” he says. He adds that the key is to make sure that the piece is accurately scaled to its space, providing maximum impact.ARNOLD Masonry & LandscapeSave Photo5. Outdoor Fire FeatureAn outdoor fireplace is the most-requested item at Arnold Masonry & Landscape in Atlanta. “People are obviously attracted to a fireplace,” says owner Scott Arnold. Many are looking to bring family and friends together or have a romantic, peaceful evening enjoying the wonderful outdoors. Arnold adds that the chimney is often the focal point of the fireplace and should be created with that in mind.Parsons shares another benefit of fire features. “They create hygge, the Scandinavian word for coziness and conviviality,” she says.

Auditory AppealAdd elements that create pleasant sounds — perhaps gently running water or a soft wind chime — to appeal to more than just your visual sense. “Sound is always a great way to ramp up a landscape,” Algozzini says.  Algozzini and Parsons both recommend water features for a variety of reasons. “Water features can add tranquility and calm,” Parson says. Algozzini says that “a well-sited fountain provides soothing tones in the landscape and a strong visual as well.”Browse fountainsLinda Greenberg Landscape & Design, LLCSave Photo7. Oversize Planters Don’t be afraid think big when it comes to planters. Linda Greenberg, a landscape designer in Charleston, South Carolina, uses oversize containers to add impact to her designs. “I love to fill them with an array of spectacular and colorful plants, textures and forms,” she says. “Both evergreen and seasonal color create quite an impression.”Alderwood Landscape Architecture and ConstructionSave PhotoAlderwood Landscape Architecture and Construction8. Dash of ColorGreenberg also recommends adding a bright color in the form of a bench or other small structure. “A strategically placed unique element, maybe painted in a bright blue or red lacquer, will add a touch of whimsy,” she says. “The pop of color is typically unexpected and will connect the colors of the interiors to the outdoors.”B.

Sense of EnclosureLandscape designer Laurie Van Zandt, who owns The Ardent Gardener Landscape Design in Huntsville, Utah, suggests creating an intimate area within the larger landscape. “You can feel almost enclosed and safe,” she says. The trick, she says, is to create a space that feels comfortable for just two people but that could also expand to accommodate larger groups.The Ardent Gardener Landscape DesignSave PhotoThe Ardent Gardener Landscape Design10. View for All SeasonsVan Zandt also encourages homeowners to create connections with their gardens for the months when they can’t be outside.  “You can add plants with winter berries and beautiful bark, [as well as] structures such as arbors and trellises and art,” she says. She also keeps rockers with wool blankets on her front porch for enjoying decent winter days outside.9 Design Tips to Enhance Views of Your Garden From IndoorsJune Scott DesignSave Photo11. Great Outdoor FurnitureDon’t overlook the importance of choosing the right outdoor furniture. “It can often be an afterthought, but we find it can really make or break a space,” says Los Angeles landscape architect June Scott. High-quality outdoor furniture often costs more than lower-quality pieces, but its longevity and ability to withstand weather can help you enjoy your yard for years to come.Choosing great patio furniture is a way to showcase your personal style too. “Outdoor furniture options are much more customized now,” Parsons says. You can find everything from new, high-end hardwood pieces to retro, repurposed and vintage ones.Shop for outdoor furniture on HouzzUrban Oasis Landscape DesignSave Photo12. Personal TouchesAlong with patio furniture and plantings, add small elements that show your personal style and reflect who you are. Your yard “should be a space where you become enthusiastic, from a love of gardening or entertaining or growing food or creating a wildlife habitat,” says Los Angeles landscape designer Deborah Gliksman of Urban Oasis Landscape & Design.Your turn: What landscape features do you think elevate a yard?

Hiring a kitchen designer could well be worth the cost to get things right. Wondering whether it’s really worth the investment? Confused about the process? For help in making an informed decision, check out this guide on how a designer can help your remodel run seamlessly, as well as some insights on cost.EYDER curated kitchensSave Photo1. Kitchen Designers Can Find MaterialsWhen it comes to finding the right materials for your countertop, flooring, cabinets and walls, a kitchen designer is well placed to locate the most appropriate ones for your project. “A good kitchen designer should be an expert in material selection and knowing which combinations are most effective,” Cathy Davis of Classic Interiors says.“They have a huge library of materials and contacts to help source the best products from reliable companies,” Diane Berry notes. This knowledge is especially useful if you’re looking for a specialty finish — a kitchen designer should be able to find a tried-and-true expert to do the job.Find a kitchen designer on HouzzCathie Hong InteriorsSave Photo2. They Can Plan a Kitchen That Will LastIf you’re going to invest in a new kitchen, it’s important to design a space you won’t want to change too quickly. You can do this by making the most of your kitchen designer’s planning skills.“The design needs to work not only for the physical shape of the room, but also for how the kitchen will be used by the clients,” Lottie McCrostie of Naked Kitchens says.“If you work closely with an experienced designer, they will hold your hand through every aspect of the design, making sure nothing is missed and ensuring there’s a place for everything,” Berry says. “You don’t want to miss things and end up adapting your purchases to suit the forgotten items.” Davis explains the process: “We’ll chat about how the client likes to cook and how they intend to use the space. From there, I can ascertain the kind of appliances, type of [countertop] and storage requirements they need.” McCrostie emphasizes the importance of continuing the discussions throughout the planning stage. “This enables changes to be made to evolve the design,” she says. “Once the plan is finalized, the client is fully connected with the design, ensuring no changes are required to simplify the process.”Need a pro for your kitchen remodeling project?Let Houzz find the best pros for youFind ProsCooper InteriorsSave Photo3. They’ll Keep Everything on Schedule“An experienced designer can ensure the planning and manufacturing stages are managed in conjunction with their client,” McCrostie says. “And they should make them aware of lead times along the way.” “It’s imperative that time scales are discussed at the outset, so everyone is singing from the same hymn sheet,” Davis says. “We work with the client’s builder and architect to ensure our lead times accord with the project time scale.” “Building projects have an order,” Berry explains. “Calling out a plasterer before the electrics are first fixed, for example, is a waste of time, energy and sometimes money. So we ensure each trade knows its dates and expectation of time needed. “We run a job making sure a day without at least one tradesman [on site] is rare,” she says. “A tiler can be preparing and tiling the floor while the plaster dries, for example.“We have warehousing, so we make sure the goods are all in stock before we start, so the installers aren’t waiting for goods to arrive. I know some of these things sound little, but a happy tradesperson does better work and an installer waiting for their materials is like a bear with a sore head.”RoundhouseSave Photo4. They Coordinate With Other ProfessionalsIf you’re redesigning your kitchen as part of a larger project, it’s essential that your kitchen designer works in line with any architect, builder or interior designer you’ve hired. “I often meet with my clients over a coffee in one of our showrooms to discuss their architectural plans in detail before we consider the kitchen design,” Davis says. “I need to understand the architect’s vision and style, so I can ensure the kitchen we create is appropriate for the space.”The same goes for interior designers, she adds. “It’s important to make sure the interior designer has the same vision to ensure the finishing touches and soft furnishings in the living space complement the kitchen perfectly.”Berry notes that a kitchen designer will have a list of trusted subcontractors and can bring in the right person for a job.Brayer DesignSave Photo5. They Know Where to Spend and Where to Save“Sometimes the simple details are expensive; at other times, a design change can save so much money,” Berry says. “Always be open and honest with your designer about money. We have the knowledge and tricks to create the wow without a wow price tag.”“I always advise my clients to spend the majority of the kitchen budget on the cabinetry and doors, as these get the most use,” Davis says. “The kitchen cabinets especially, although not necessarily seen, take the weight of the [countertop] and need to stay rigid for many years, so the doors stay aligned. I use the analogy of a car: You don’t see the chassis, but it needs to be high-quality to ensure a great vehicle.“Where I often suggest clients can save money is on the appliances. We only sell quality brands, which means their entry-level products are still excellent quality, using the same components as the more expensive models. The difference is often in the features available, so I have a good chat with my clients to work out what features they can live without to help them choose the best-value appliances for their budget.”McCrostie offers another tip: “Where a kitchen is totally custom, wider drawer stacks can be designed into the plan to reduce the overall number of cabinets, as drawers are more expensive than cupboards.”Phil Kean KitchensSave Photo6. They Can Ensure That Your Appliances Are Energy-EfficientIt’s not just the initial outlay you need to consider when designing a kitchen — the cost of running appliances is also key. A kitchen designer will be able to advise on the most energy-efficient models for your budget. “We have training throughout the year with Siemens, NEFF and Miele to ensure we can manage our customers’ expectations and inform them on the best appliances to suit their needs,” Davis says.“We can offer lots of help on which appliances are most efficient and, importantly, which programs are too,” Berry says. “For example, so many people with 1½ ovens use the small oven to save money, yet mostly the larger oven costs less to run. Large ovens usually work with a single heating element and a fan, while small ovens often run two elements. It goes against logic, but it’s a good-to-know fact.“With dishwashers, often the programs that take longer are more cost-efficient. They’re often heating the same amount of water to do the wash and they then recycle the rinse water too. So longer doesn’t mean more expensive and often means less water.”Tell us: Are you considering hiring a kitchen designer?

It should also be a retreat — a place in which you feel relaxed and nurtured. All too often, though, our houses slip into a more perfunctory role. Sometimes they even cause stress, confronting us with reminders  of things to do as soon as we step through the door. How can we steer our homes toward more cozy shores? Try these mood-enhancing ideas and housekeeping tips to add comfort and keep the to-do-list worries at bay. Christine McGovern DesignSave PhotoWork With the SeasonsAllow your home to reflect the time of year, and it will feel more enjoyable and nourishing. In the winter, put up heavy drapes that can be closed to keep in the heat, then light candles and, if possible, a fire to create a sense of coziness and protection from the elements.In the warmer months, open the windows so you can hear the birds, hang gauzy curtains to let in lots of warm, soft light and dot your rooms with wildflowers.Find an interior designer near youDLT Interiors-Debbie TravinSave PhotoGet the Lighting RightGood lighting can lift the mood of a room and help it function better.

Scent can help us unwind and may carry associations of places we love and bring back fond memories.

166590049,Before and After: 4 Kitchen Remodels With Smart Storage Solutions,"Pullouts, inserts and careful planning ensure that these newly renovated kitchens pack it all in and stay organized too",Suzanne Ennis,https://www.houzz.com/magazine/before-and-after-4-kitchen-remodels-with-smart-storage-solutions-stsetivw-vs~166590049,"Whether a kitchen is large or small, storage that’s well-organized and logically placed is key to the space running smoothly and efficiently — and looking neat and tidy. With that in mind, these pros (including one found on Houzz) not only added more storage when renovating, but also made that storage smarter and harder-working, with specialized drawers, space-saving designs and other clever and clutter-busting solutions. Check out their ideas below, and see more of each kitchen by clicking the link at the end of its description.Before PhotoBecky HarrisSave PhotoPhotos by Adam Kane Macchia1. Made to MeasureKitchen at a GlanceWho lives here: A family of fourLocation: Mamaroneck, New YorkSize: 238 square feet (22 square meters); 14 by 17 feetDesigner: Sarah Robertson of Studio DearbornBefore: Although this kitchen was in good shape, its layout didn’t work well for the homeowners, who love to entertain. The rarely used built-in desk also wasted space. So they hired their friend and neighbor, kitchen and bath designer Sarah Robertson, to redesign it. To ensure that the various components wouldn’t end up in the landfill, Robertson hired an organization called Renovation Angel to remove them for resale and reuse, with the profits going to charity.Hire a local kitchen designerStudio DearbornSave PhotoAfter: Robertson pulled in the blue, white and walnut color scheme from the rest of the house and sprinkled in some industrial elements to add personality. The former kitchen lacked sufficient food storage space, so she replaced the desk with a pantry and fridge wall. Moving the refrigerator to the other side of the room made space for bigger windows over the sink; new glass cabinets on either side hold attractive dishware and let the sun shine through.Robertson custom-designed a zinc-and-brass range hood as the new kitchen’s focal point. On either side of the range, pullouts keep utensils and cooking supplies at the cook’s fingertips, and the drawer beneath the countertop cabinet holds herbs and spices.Blue cabinet paint: Ocean Floor, Benjamin Moore; white cabinet paint: Calm, Benjamin Moore; Prouvé counter stools: Industry West; rug: Old New HouseStudio DearbornSave PhotoA new island measuring 3½ by 8 feet and topped by the same Jet Mist granite used on the perimeter cabinets adds even more storage space. Instead of using all lower cabinets, Robertson opted for drawers, which she says are more efficient and ergonomic.She took a careful inventory of everything her clients wanted to store, then fitted the drawers with inserts. For example, slats in this drawer keep food containers and lids organized.Shop for kitchen storage and organizationStudio DearbornSave PhotoAngled slats in this drawer divide and store pots and their lids.Read more about this kitchen remodel Before PhotoVermont Interior DesignSave Photo“After” photos by Spencer Davis Real Estate Photography2. Pulling Out the StopsKitchen at a GlanceWho lives here: Mike and Olivia Sprague and their dogLocation: St. Albans, VermontSize: 189 square feet (18 square meters)Designer: Britt Mee of Vermont Interior DesignBefore: Mike and Olivia Sprague had great mountain and lake views from their 79-square-foot kitchen. But its G-shaped layout offered limited counter space, and its cabinets, appliances and finishes were aging poorly.They hired designer Britt Mee to design cabinets and a cabinet layout to improve flow and storage space. Mike, who works for a custom builder, handled the structural changes.New to home remodeling? Click here to learn the basicsVermont Interior DesignSave PhotoAfter: Despite the similarities, this photo was taken from a totally different vantage point than the “before” photo. In fact, what you’re seeing here was once the dining room. Mee and Mike swapped the kitchen and dining areas and took down the range wall between them to expand the kitchen by 110 square feet. New custom frameless maple cabinetry is painted a blue-gray (Cadet by Sherwin-Williams) and topped with white marble-look quartz countertops. The kitchen’s expanded L-shaped layout with an island features much more counter and storage space.New European oak flooring adds warmth to the cool color scheme.Custom cabinets: Bouchard-Pierce; paint: Super White (walls and ceiling) and Swiss Coffee (trim), Benjamin MooreVermont Interior DesignSave PhotoThe cabinets conceal all kinds of smart features. For example, this pantry area to the right of the sink has a countertop cabinet for small appliances and other items. Pullouts below make it easy to see all of the stored dry goods.Vermont Interior DesignSave PhotoBlind corners often have underutilized space. That’s not the case in this cabinet to the right of the range, which features kidney-shaped pullouts holding pans and a teakettle.Other hidden storage features include a two-tiered drawer for utensils, a specialized spice drawer and a divided cabinet for baking sheets and other tall items.Read more about this kitchen remodelBefore PhotoBecky HarrisSave Photo“After” photos by Sheldon Ivester of Ivester Creative3. Everything in Its PlaceKitchen at a GlanceWho lives here: A coupleLocation: Rancho Santa Fe, CaliforniaSize: 284 square feet (26 square meters) plus pantry and breakfast roomDesigners: Bonnie Bagley Catlin of Signature Designs Kitchen Bath (kitchen design) and T7 Architecture (architecture)Before: The kitchen was part of a larger remodel aimed at giving this 1980s-era ranch house a warm, modern style. But it wasn’t just the existing kitchen’s style that didn’t match the owners’ vision — the layout didn’t work with their lifestyle, either. They cook with their extended family, and this peninsula hemmed in the work area and blocked easy access to the refrigerator behind it. Kitchen and bath designer Bonnie Bagley Catlin came aboard the renovation to tackle those issues.Signature Designs Kitchen | Bath | InteriorsSave PhotoAfter: Catlin created a zoned layout with multiple areas for prep, cooking and coffee, plus a large island in the center of the kitchen. The island has seating, an ice maker, a second dishwasher, open shelves for cookbooks, specialized storage and a prep sink.The new cabinetry is laminate that looks like wood.  The perimeter cabinets are topped with light-colored quartz counters. Black Portoro quartzite with a honed finish tops the island.Signature Designs Kitchen | Bath | InteriorsSave PhotoTo maximize windows and counter space, Catlin made the lower cabinets along the perimeter and in the island as efficient as possible. For example, across from the main sink and dishwasher, she outfitted the island’s drawers with inserts and dowels for utensils, plates and other items. A built-in knife block drawer is next to the island’s prep sink. Signature Designs Kitchen | Bath | InteriorsSave PhotoTo the right of the refrigerator, a lighted coffee station includes one of the room’s two upper cabinets with glass doors framed in black aluminum. The coffee maker sits on a shelf that rolls out for easy access, and there’s an outlet next to it. A custom drawer insert holds coffee pods.Read more about this kitchen remodelBefore PhotoKnocknockSave Photo“After” photos by Olga Soboleva of Rave PhotoKitchen at a GlanceWho lives here: A couple with two kidsLocation: Piedmont, CaliforniaSize: 185 square feet (17 square meters)Designer: Nadja Pentic of Knocknock4. Each Inch PinchedBefore: Lighting in unprofessional “before” snapshots rarely does a room any favors. But even the best lighting couldn’t have helped the skimpy broken cabinets, old appliances and cluttered, hard-to-clean tile countertops in this L-shaped kitchen.The owners wanted to keep the layout but add improved storage, updated appliances and a more streamlined, midcentury modern look. While gathering inspiration photos on Houzz, they found designer Nadja Pentic.KnocknockSave PhotoAfter: Pentic transformed the space with sleek, all-new appliances, flat-panel white upper cabinets and walnut lower cabinets and a polished marble backsplash in a modern geometric floral pattern.By moving the washer and dryer out of the kitchen, Pentic could extend the run of cabinets the full length of the window wall. A blind corner cabinet to the left of the range has a two-tiered pullout to help use the space efficiently.KnocknockSave PhotoThe addition of a pantry pullout to the right of the fridge added a ton of easy-to-access storage. Below it is a pullout trash and recycling center. KnocknockSave PhotoOn the adjacent wall, across from a new wine fridge, white glass doors hide another pantry that’s deep enough to be useful but not so deep that food gets lost in the back. A yellow interior adds an energizing jolt of color.Read more about this kitchen remodelYour turn: What’s the most clever  storage or organization solution in your kitchen?

122561609,How to Design a Kitchen That’s Easy to Clean,Eager to reduce scrubbing time? Get expert advice on making easy maintenance part of your kitchen plan,Victoria Harrison,https://www.houzz.com/magazine/how-to-design-a-kitchen-thats-easy-to-clean-stsetivw-vs~122561609,"The kitchen tends to be the room in our home that needs the most cleaning. The good news is that, with a little planning, you can have a design that makes cleaning a breeze and allows you to spend less time mopping and more time enjoying your space. Check out these expert tips from Eva Byrne of Houseology; Nicolle Whyte, designer at Harvey Jones; and Louise Delaney, design manager at Cameron Interiors.Hello KitchenSave PhotoBuy Easy-Clean AppliancesIt’s understandable to be dazzled by the performance or look of a smart new kitchen appliance, but Byrne suggests that you also consider potential purchases with a view to keeping them clean. “Choose a [range] that’s fuss-free and easy to wipe down without needing any exotic lotions or solutions,” she says. “Have a good look at details, such as the knobs on your oven, to make sure there are no hard-to-get-at nooks. Knobs that are too close together mean you can’t get a cloth between them, for example.”Whyte agrees and suggests choosing an induction cooktop, “as it’s flat, easy and safe to clean.” Furthermore, Delaney says, induction cooktops save you from having to clean the grates and other parts found on gas cooktops.Find a kitchen designer near you on HouzzRoot ConstructionSave Photo“We recommend choosing appliances with cleaning programs included,” Delaney says. “Let your appliance do the cleaning for you!” She suggests choosing ovens with pyrolytic cleaning functions (which heat the oven to high temperatures to burn off residue), steam ovens with automatic steam cleaning and drying programs, and coffee machines with automatic cleaning.DCLA Develop+Design+BuildSave PhotoPick a Simple BacksplashTile is a popular choice for a kitchen backsplash, but if you don’t want to spend time scrubbing grout to keep it sparkling clean, there are other options.If you’re set on tile, pick a large-format style to minimize the amount of grout you have to clean. If you choose a glass backsplash, you won’t have to deal with grout at all, Whyte points out.Shop for backsplash tileUrbana Design StudioSave PhotoFavor Flat-Front Cabinets“Selecting smooth furniture fronts prevents cooking residue forming on decorative grooves and ridges,” Delaney says. Watch out for cutout pulls, though, since they can harbor crumbs.Save PhotoChoose Your Countertop Material Wisely“Select materials such as Corian, quartz, steel or sintered stone [mineral and stone particles bound together with heat and pressure], which are nonporous, prevent stains and are easy to wipe clean,” Delaney says.“Solid-surface [countertops], such as Corian, are probably the most hygienic,” Whyte says. “They have a seamless finish and therefore don’t have grooves to trap dirt. This is why you see them used in hospitals and fast-food chains.”Your Guide to 15 Popular Kitchen Countertop MaterialsRiemer Kitchens & Fine CabinetrySave PhotoUse Durable PaintIf you have painted walls in your kitchen, you’ll need to wipe them down more often than the walls in other rooms. Choosing a hardwearing paint finish will make this job easier.“Use an oil-based eggshell [finish], as you can easily wipe this clean without damaging the paint,” Whyte says.Pick the Right Paint Finish to Fit Your StylePlain & PoshSave PhotoAvoid Open ShelvesOpen shelves may look attractive when beautifully styled, but they can be a high-maintenance cleaning option if you have to move dishes, books and decorative objects just to run a duster over the surface.For a fuss-free kitchen design, Byrne recommends avoiding open shelves “that gather dust and grime” and springing for wall cabinets instead.PKsurroundingsSave PhotoUse Drawer and Shelf LinersDrawers can be a bit of a minefield to keep tidy, with crumbs and dust sifting down to settle at the bottom. To keep on top of this, Byrne suggests lining drawers and shelves “with wipeable liner material, cut to size, to prolong the life of your units.”Whyte agrees and suggests choosing “a melamine finish on the inside of cabinets, as it doesn’t absorb spillages like oak or walnut would.”PJ BUILDERSSave PhotoTell us: Which of these ideas would you use?

165061772,Kitchen of the Week: Zoned Layout and 4 Cabinet Finishes,A designer collaborates closely with the homeowners to create a kitchen with two islands for cooking and entertaining,Becky Harris,https://www.houzz.com/magazine/kitchen-of-the-week-zoned-layout-and-4-cabinet-finishes-stsetivw-vs~165061772,"While interior designer Andrea Lynn Orndorff was at her dentist’s office, she got an earful about how lost the good doctor and her husband were with a kitchen renovation they were about to start. She quickly sussed out that the couple had jumped to the construction planning phase with a contractor before completing a thorough design phase. “They were looking at floor plans that hadn’t considered how the kitchen would work for them long-term, and suddenly they had to make a lot of decisions very quickly,” the designer says. “I told her they needed to slow things down because design is a process that takes time.” Before she knew it, she had moved from the dentist’s chair to the lead designer’s chair, taking her clients back to the start. “We needed to figure out what was important to them, what was working for them and what wasn’t, how they saw themselves in the space, how they function when cooking and entertaining and what inspired them,” Orndorff says. The result is a beautiful zoned layout with two islands, in a striking palette that mixes four cabinetry finishes: walnut, cherry, white and navy blue.Before PhotoBecky HarrisSave Photo“After” photos by Tracey Brown of  PapercameraKitchen at a GlanceWho lives here: John and Karen Roschella Location: Cooksville, MarylandSize: 330 square feet (31 square meters)Designer: Andrea Lynn Orndorff of A. Lynn DesignContractor: Rich Judd of Glenwood Kitchen and BathBefore: The formal dining room was located behind the  kitchen. “They didn’t use their dining room. It was pretty empty because they had it set up as a yoga studio during the shutdown,” Orndorff says. The homeowners, Karen and John Roschella, note that the kitchen appliances were reaching their end of life, the design was a bit outdated, the cabinets and countertops were of low quality, the island didn’t have seating and the space felt cramped when everyone congregated there.The angled island cut off the kitchen and made circulation through it awkward. The space to the left of the kitchen was a breakfast room. You may also notice the blue painter’s tape on the floor — Orndorff used this to give her clients an idea of how the space would be transformed after the renovation. Find an interior designer on HouzzA. Lynn DesignSave PhotoAfter: The homeowners and Orndorff talked extensively about function, and the resulting layout was a group effort. The designer pushed the kitchen footprint all the way to the back wall of the dining room, taking over that entire space. Because of the expansion, it’s a little tricky to compare this photo with the previous one. The tall blue pantry cabinet next to the opening is in the approximate spot where the white door is in the “before” photo. Karen and John both had strong ideas about what they wanted in the new kitchen. “We wanted the new space to have island seating for at least four, we wanted to upgrade our appliances to more of a chef’s kitchen, and we wanted more useful storage for our small kitchen appliances,” Karen says. “This was a true collaboration with them,” Orndorff says. “John loved the idea of having two islands: a work island near the range and another one that would include seating. The main island is a real workhorse — it has the sink, the dishwasher, storage and seating.” The main island is cherry with a dark brown stain.The designer also replaced the existing tile floor with quartersawn white oak with a light stain. The oak was installed throughout the entire first floor as part of the project.Paint colors: Half Moon Crest (walls) and Blue Note (pantry cabinets), Benjamin MooreA. Lynn DesignSave PhotoThis walnut island was John’s baby and the couple refer to it as “the worktable.” “He thought of this island kind of like a butcher’s work island, and he loved the idea of an open feel to it,” Orndorff says.  The refrigerator is located outside of this photo’s frame along the wall to the left of the range wall. This island helps form a work triangle between the fridge and the range. Orndorff tucked the electrical outlet on the side of the island. Shop for kitchen lightingA. Lynn DesignSave PhotoThe island is a rich walnut. “The walnut really kicked off the materials. The wood has such rich tones,” Orndorff says. “The design was a true collaboration between John, the cabinetmaker and me.” The hardware is matte black.A. Lynn DesignSave PhotoThe open display shelving on the island wraps around three sides.A. Lynn DesignSave PhotoThe island’s soapstone countertop is a departure from the rest of the counter surfaces in the room, playing beautifully off the custom blackened steel hood. It was crafted by local company AK Metal Fabricators.“We wanted to add some brass accents but didn’t want it to be overkill,” Orndorff says. A simple brass band adds just the right amount of flash to the hood. Also note that the pendant lights over this island are a different color and shape than the pendants over the larger island. Brass accents tie them together. “We wanted to give each island its own unique lights that would complement each other,” Orndorff says. “We went for larger scales because it keeps them from looking  cluttered.”Before PhotoBecky HarrisSave PhotoBefore: The stovetop was in the island and there were two wall ovens.A. Lynn DesignSave PhotoAfter: The new range combines the stovetop and oven in one spot. This wall’s white cabinetry adds some strong contrast to the rich wood tones and the blue cabinetry in the room.  “John loved the movement in this quartz and loved the idea of continuing it up the backsplash,” Orndorff says. Also adding to the contrast is the black range hood. Matte black hardware ties into the hood and soapstone. “Andrea  always solicited our ideas and used those to direct us toward the final design,” Karen says. “She was instrumental in ensuring we maximized storage and removed any aesthetically troublesome design choices.” Browse range hoods in the Houzz ShopA.

This was an important aspect of the design for the homeowners. “Even when we are working and have our appliances out, it never feels crowded,” Karen says.Hire a kitchen remodelerA. Lynn DesignSave PhotoOrndorff crafted the pantry wall to stand alone as its own entity within the kitchen. The deep blue paint works well with the rich wood tones and white in the room. And honey brass hardware pops against the hue. The glazed ceramic tile backsplash is different than the backsplash on the range wall. The floating shelves are walnut and the countertop matches the perimeter and main island counters. “We sprinkled the walnut around,” Orndorff says.The countertop cabinet doors pocket back so they can be tucked out of the way. The cabinet on the left is a bar cabinet and the one on the right is a coffee station.“We would have been overwhelmed without Andrea guiding us in selecting the finishes and lighting,” Karen says. “We would have never thought of or been brave enough to choose a four-color cabinet palette. She had the vision and was spot-on with the decision.”Before PhotoBecky HarrisSave PhotoBefore: This alcove sat between the kitchen and the breakfast room.A. Lynn DesignSave PhotoAfter: The designer took advantage of the alcove, transforming it into a wine storage area. She repeated the use of the deep blue paint and walnut to tie it into the cabinetry. “They like to collect wine and this was a great spot that’s convenient to the kitchen and the eating area,” Orndorff says. She carefully crafted each part of the kitchen to stand on its own while working as part of a cohesive whole. “Each part of this room has its heyday — the hood, the worktable, the pantry cabinet wall and this wine station,” Orndorff says. “I’m so happy Karen and John took the time to have the focus and presence for us to get it right.”Becky HarrisSave PhotoBefore: On the existing kitchen’s floor plan, the dining room is located along the right side, behind the wall ovens. The eat-in area is at the top.Becky HarrisSave PhotoAfter: Now that kitchen has taken over the dining room space, it has a much larger footprint. Note that later in the design process, the seating and sink locations in the main island were flipped. The breakfast room eat-in area, located at the top of the plan, now doubles as the formal dining space.  “We really love everything about the kitchen,” Karen says. “I love the farmhouse sink, open shelving, amount of storage and countertop space. John loves the custom ‘worktable’ and wine storage area that Andrea designed.  Both are stunning. We are in love with the kitchen, it is the heart of our home. When we entertain, everyone congregates in the kitchen and around the island.”Part of Orndorff’s job can involve tempering clients’ expectations regarding time. These clients are glad they took a pause and slowed down to complete a thorough design process with her. She’s happy that they’ve fallen in love with their home all over again. “Design is a process, and it takes time for clients to process what they need and what the proposed solutions could be,” Orndorff says. “They need to envision themselves in the space years down the line. This process requires some time. And by the way, it should be enjoyable!”More on HouzzRead more kitchen storiesBrowse kitchen photosHire a kitchen remodelerShop for kitchen products","['Kitchen Makeovers', 'Kitchen of the Week',

166931222,See How Various Age Groups Are Spending Their Remodeling Dollars,"Gen Xers spend more than boomers, and millennials update interiors the most, the 2023 U.S. Houzz & Home Study reveals",Mitchell Parker,https://www.houzz.com/magazine/see-how-various-age-groups-are-spending-their-remodeling-dollars-stsetivw-vs~166931222,"It seems like boom time for baby boomers. The majority (59%) of that generation, composed of 55- to 74-year-olds, remodeled their homes in 2022, followed distantly by Gen Xers (27%), who are 40 to 54 years old. But don’t discount Gen Xers’ remodeling influence. In 2022, Gen Xers surpassed baby boomers in median renovation spend for the first time since Houzz began tracking spend in 2014 — $25,000 versus $24,000, respectively. Here you can learn more about those and other remodeling behaviors, broken down by generational group, from the recently released 2023 U.S. Houzz & Home Study. Save Photo1. Most Homeowners Plan to Stay PutAs mentioned, baby boomers comprise the largest group of renovating homeowners, followed by Gen Xers, as shown here in the pie graph. A smaller share of millennials (9%), who are 25 to 39 years old, and seniors (5%), who are 75 or older, renovated in 2022. Perhaps not surprisingly, Gen Zers, who are ages 18 to 24, made up a nominal share of renovating homeowners (0.1%).Meanwhile, the majority of renovating homeowners across three generational categories plan to stay in their primary residence for at least another 11 years; those categories are Gen Xers (59%), baby boomers (63%) and seniors (67%). And nearly half of renovating homeowners in the millennials cohort plan to stay in their homes for that long.For the study, generational categories follow Pew Research Center’s age ranges: Gen Zers (18 to 24), millennials (25 to 39), Gen Xers (40 to 54), baby boomers (55 to 74) and seniors (75 and older).Many Homeowners Plan to Stay Put and Renovate Rather Than SellJessica Nelson DesignSave PhotoBathrooms are popular spaces to renovate among millennials and older generations.

Gen Xers Topped Baby Boomers in SpendIn 2022, for the first time since the Houzz & Home Study began collecting data in 2014, Gen Xers surpassed baby boomers in median spend for renovation projects — $25,000 for Gen Xers, compared with $24,000 for boomers. Millennials and seniors both had a median spend of $20,000.  While Gen Xers invested in kitchen remodels on par with baby boomers — each with a $22,000 median spend — boomers invested more than Gen Xers in bathroom upgrades ($15,000 versus $12,000, respectively). But millennials’ purchasing power is on the rise. The median spend for this group increased by 33% since 2021 and has doubled since 2020.How to Choose a Bathroom Vanity: Your Step-by-Step GuideKSI Kitchen & BathSave PhotoFor this Detroit kitchen, KSI Kitchen & Bath used lots of quartersawn oak cabinets to add style and storage.

Gen Xers Turned to Secured Home LoansAcross all age groups, cash from savings was by far the most frequently used funding source for home renovations in 2022. Nearly 9 in 10 millennials and more than 4 in 5 Gen Xers and baby boomers used their savings to fund home upgrades.Credit cards were the second-most-used funding source across all age groups in 2022, but millennials relied on credit cards more than older generations.Meanwhile, Gen Xers relied on secured home loans the most (20%) compared with other generations. Boomers and seniors were more likely than members of any other age group to use cash from a previous homes sale (14% each). And millennials were more likely to use a gift or inheritance (11%) or a tax refund (8%) to fund a home renovation than those in other age groups.

Millennials Led in System and Interior UpdatesInterior updates were the most common projects tackled in 2022 across all age groups. A slightly larger share of millennials tackled interior room remodels — 77%, compared with 75% of Gen Xers, 71% of baby boomers and 68% of seniors. Millennials also tackled the most home system upgrades (72%) in 2022, compared with 68% of Gen Xers, 63% of boomers and 61% of seniors.Seniors were the least likely to take on outdoor upgrades (46%), compared with millennials (52%), Gen Xers (51%) and baby boomers (52%).In the study, “interior room remodels” refers to remodels of kitchens, bathrooms, dining rooms and similar spaces. “Home system upgrades” refers to upgrades of things like electrical, plumbing and air conditioning systems. “Home exterior upgrades” refers to upgrades of windows, roofing and other features. “Additions” are expansions of the home’s footprint by increasing the square footage of kitchens, dining rooms and similar spaces. “Outdoor upgrades” refers to upgrades of structures such as decks and gazebos, features including lawns and fences, and systems such as irrigation and lighting.

About a fourth of homeowners across all age groups updated a primary bathroom in 2022.But the top priorities for millennials were automation (34%) and security upgrades (31%), as shown in the bottom-right corner of this graphic. Millennials were more likely to take on these types of projects than members of older generations.

Pro Hiring Was Widespread Across Generations The overwhelming majority of renovating homeowners across all generational groups hired professionals in 2022. Nearly 9 in 10 millennials and Gen Xers relied on pro help, trailing seniors (94%) and baby boomers (92%) only slightly. Gen Xers and seniors relied on construction professionals the most among all the age groups (46% each), while baby boomers hired the most specialty service providers (48%). Boomers also hired design-related pros most frequently (27%).In the study, specialty service provider hiring does not include any specialists hired with the help of a construction manager (general contractor, builder, design-build company and/or kitchen or bath remodeler). Construction professionals are general contractors, kitchen or bathroom remodelers, builders and design-build professionals. Design-related pros are kitchen or bath designers, architects, interior designers or decorators, landscape architects or designers, and lighting designers.Discerning DesignsSave PhotoInterior design firm Discerning Designs updated this Houston laundry room with terrazzo-look porcelain floor tile and custom cabinets that include a drying cabinet fronted with wire mesh.Save Photo7. Lighting Was Preferred Over Large Furniture OutdoorsDecorating often goes hand in hand with renovating, and more than 4 in 5 millennials (82%) who renovated in 2022 tackled a decorating project. The majority of Gen Xers (73%) and baby boomers (64%) also decorated. For boomers, top decorating projects included large furniture (59%) and storage solutions (46%). When it came to outdoor decorating, lighting was a top priority. More homeowners across all generations purchased lighting over large furniture.In the study, “interior large furniture” refers to items such as lounge sets, dining sets and dressers. “Outdoor large

166602987,8 Things Pros Recommend for Your Outdoor Kitchen,Landscape design experts share their advice on what to include in an outdoor kitchen,Marianne Lipanovich,https://www.houzz.com/magazine/8-things-pros-recommend-for-your-outdoor-kitchen-stsetivw-vs~166602987,"An outdoor kitchen is more than just a spot for a grill. It draws people into your yard and becomes a space for family dinners and entertaining friends throughout the year. If an outdoor kitchen is on your list of home projects, read on to see what landscape experts prioritize in their designs.Hursthouse Landscape Architects and ContractorsSave PhotoHursthouse Landscape Architects and Contractors1. The Right GrillLandscape architect Bob Hursthouse, an avid griller himself, tells homeowners to consider how they plan to use the grill before making a final choice on the size, style and other features. “Will you be doing basic grilling, smoking food [or] something else?” the Bolingbrook, Illinois, professional asks.This is also the item you should prioritize in terms of cost. “A good-quality grill with a lifetime warranty is the most important thing,” Katherine Douglass of TCP Custom Outdoor Living in Houston says. “Being able to cook your meals outside always adds some type of indescribable flavor and is great fun,” says Atlanta-based building and masonry expert Scott Arnold.What to Know About Choosing a Built-In GrillTCP Custom Outdoor LivingSave PhotoTCP Custom Outdoor Living2. Gorgeous CountertopsCounters help define your outdoor kitchen’s style. “Choose a stone [or other material] that ties the whole look together or provides a fun accent,” says Kara Gorski of Landed in Alexandria, Virginia. Practical considerations. Add plenty of countertop area around the grill. “No matter how small an outdoor kitchen is, it needs to have adequate counter space,” says landscape designer Deborah Gliksman of Urban Oasis Landscape Design in Los Angeles. Douglass recommends leaving enough room for utensils as well as your cooked and uncooked food. New York-based landscape designer Todd Haiman says you’ll probably need to seal the countertop when it’s installed and then reseal it every few years. “Fats from cooking as well as staining from metals left on top of it can stain it, and the elements can take their toll,” he says. Finally, make good use of the cabinetry the counters sit on. It’s a prime space for storage as well as other amenities, such as an undercounter refrigerator.Find a landscape contractor near you on HouzzGDL PropertySave PhotoGDL Property3. SmokerMany of the pros we spoke with are seeing smokers being added to outdoor kitchens. “A smoker is extremely popular and should be considered if you enjoy smoked meats,” Arnold says. It also serves as a secondary grill spot for larger gatherings.8 Impressive Grills That Will Elevate an Outdoor KitchenMoazami HomesSave PhotoMoazami Homes4. Outdoor RefrigeratorLooking for a space to store drinks or a way to keep food chilled before grilling or serving? Haiman says an outdoor refrigerator can be a great addition to an outdoor kitchen. Douglass adds that you can take it a step further by including an ice machine.Seventh Street InteriorsSave PhotoSeventh Street Interiors5. Splashy Backsplash“Once the utilitarian needs are taken care of, spice up an outdoor kitchen with an eye-catching backsplash,” Gliksman says. Along with providing a bright accent, a standout backsplash adds a finishing touch while keeping utensils and food from falling off the back of the counter.David Charlez DesignsSave PhotoDavid Charlez Designs6. SinkA nearby water source can be convenient during food prep and cleanup. That’s why Haiman recommends a small sink for any outdoor kitchen. Just be aware that adding a sink requires tapping into the existing plumbing and sewer lines, which can be complicated. The sink, along with any refrigeration unit, will also need to be winterized in cold climates.LandedSave PhotoLanded7. Pizza OvenWhen it comes to adding fun features to an outdoor kitchen, most of the pros we spoke with put a pizza oven near the top of their list. The ovens aren’t just for pizzas — you can roast or bake anything from appetizers to desserts. Just leave enough room on either side of the oven for workspace. “You’ll want at least 18 inches on one side  and 24 inches on the other, for a total of 36 inches of clear counter space,” Gliksman says. Shop for outdoor pizza ovens on HouzzUrban Oasis Landscape DesignSave PhotoUrban Oasis Landscape Design8. Edible GardenEasily add fresh herbs and vegetables to your outdoor meals by siting an edible garden near the grill and prep areas. “A nearby planter with herbs, such as rosemary, thyme, sage and parsley, is a nice culinary complement for the outdoor chef,” Haiman says. If you have more room, add greens and summer favorites such as tomatoes and peppers.What to Know About Adding or Renovating an Edible GardenARNOLD Masonry & LandscapeSave PhotoArnold Masonry & LandscapeOther Considerations for an Outdoor KitchenOutdoor lighting. Every outdoor kitchen has different needs, but great lighting is high on everyone’s list. Task lighting over the grill and work areas, along with ambient light for both atmosphere and safety, should always be incorporated into your design. Seating. A nearby table and chairs makes serving up what you’ve created a cinch. You can also add a lounge area or a countertop with seating so the cook can partake in the conversations (and maybe get some help with prep work).New to home remodeling?

To get sparkling windows, a clutter-free garage and more, here are 16 tasks to make the most of the first full month of spring.Keri Murray ArchitectureSave PhotoThings to Check Off Your List in an Hour or Less1. Keep mosquitoes at bay. Having warmer weather and longer days means we’re entering mosquito season. Take preventative measures by regularly checking your property for standing water and emptying it. Any open containers (empty flowerpots and saucers, a wheelbarrow) can become mosquito breeding grounds when filled with rainwater, so store items like these upside down or in a shed.2. Inspect paths and driveway. Repeated freezing and thawing can take a toll on asphalt and concrete. Check your driveway and paths for cracks, scheduling repairs as needed.Find a landscape contractor on HouzzStudio 316 Creative, LLCSave Photo3. Clean out trash cans and recycling bins. Take empty cans outside and spray them with a hose to start. Spritz inside and out with the cleaning spray of your choice. Let the bins sit for a few minutes before scrubbing them with a stiff-bristle brush. Rinse with the hose and leave them upside down to dry.4. Check safety devices. Test batteries on smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, replacing them as needed. It’s also a good idea to periodically check for recalls of your home safety products; you can find up-to-date listings at Recalls.gov.Browse smoke and monoxide detectors in the Houzz ShopDK StudioSave PhotoTackle These Tasks Over a Weekend5. Clear clutter. Create more space in your home by clearing out unloved items. If you have a lot to get rid of, set a date to hold a yard sale. Or contact a local charity to schedule a pickup — some will send a truck free of charge if you’re donating large items like furniture. If you have a lot of one type of item (for example, books or baby clothes), look for a consignment shop in your town where you may be able to sell them.6. Schedule cooling-system maintenance. If you have central air conditioning, be sure to schedule professional maintenance before the start of summer. A properly maintained system cools better, uses less energy and lasts longer.Three Magic Words for a Clean Home and a Better LifeOne Girl InteriorsSave Photo7. Spruce up the front porch. Clean the porch floor, exterior windows, windowsills and front door. Wipe cobwebs from the ceiling and high corners. Lay down a fresh doormat, and plant a pot of flowers. If you have porch furniture, clean it off and wash the cushions.8. Test sprinklers and irrigation system. Don’t let the first sign of a malfunctioning irrigation system be a drooping garden! Take the time this month to test each part, adjusting or repairing as needed. And if you don’t already have drip irrigation for your garden, consider putting it in — a properly installed system can save time and water.How to Install a Drip Irrigation SystemSave Photo9. Wash windows. Welcome the spring sunshine by clearing dirt and grime from windows inside and out. After cleaning the glass, take an extra moment to wipe the window frame and sill.10. Clean and inspect screen doors and windows. Pollen and grime can also build up on window screens, so it’s a good idea to clean them once a year. For a quick cleaning, leave screens in place and vacuum with a dusting attachment. For a deeper cleaning, remove screens (mark which is which if cleaning multiple windows) and gently scrub with warm, soapy water. Rinse and let dry.Before putting up window screens and screen doors, inspect each one for holes and rips — even small tears can let in mosquitoes. If you find any holes, repair them with a screen patch kit (available at most hardware stores).Shop for household cleaning suppliesOrganized LivingSave Photo11. Clean out the garage. Can you park your car in your garage? If not (or if it’s a tight fit), it may be time to make some more space. Clear out the junk, and schedule time to take unused paint, motor oil and other hazardous items to a recycling center that accepts them. (If you’re not sure where to go, search Earth911 to find a center near you.) Once your garage is cleaned out, consider adding wall-mounted storage to keep things neat and off the floor.Garage Cleaning Tips for the OverwhelmedDonald Lococo ArchitectsSave Photo12. Wash siding. Using a regular garden hose, attach a siding cleaning kit (available at most home improvement stores) to clear away winter grime from your home’s siding. If your siding could use a really deep cleaning, it can be tempting to use a pressure washer to get the job done quickly. But if you do, use it with care: Consumer Reports advises avoiding any pressure washer that comes with a 0-degree nozzle, because it can be too dangerous (to you and your house) and wider nozzles can get the job done just as well. A better strategy would be to contact a professional to do the work for you.How to Wash Your HouseBenjamin Hill PhotographySave PhotoMaintenance and Extras to Budget for This Month13. Clean gutters and downspouts. Having your home’s gutters and downspouts cleaned (and repaired if necessary) is one of the first important tasks to schedule this season. Clogged gutters during a rainy spring can cause water to pool, potentially damaging the roof and siding.Tara BussemaSave Photo14. Boost curb appeal. Spring is a wonderful time to make upgrades to your home’s exterior, and even small changes — like putting up bold house numbers and a shiny new mailbox — can make a big impact.

Check gates, fencing, decks, railings, pergolas and other outdoor structures, and make repairs as needed.16. Keep an eye out for termites. From now through May or June, be on the lookout for these winged insects. “Termites swarm in the spring,” says Victor Sedinger, certified home inspector and owner of House Exam Inspection and Consulting. “If there’s a bunch of winged insects flying out of a hole in the woodwork, that’s probably termites.” If you notice any, call a licensed professional pest-control company.Find a

166603397,"Bathroom of the Week: Modern, Chic and Wheelchair-Accessible","A design-savvy couple, one of whom uses a wheelchair, get a stylish bathroom tailored to their current and future needs",Suzanne Ennis,https://www.houzz.com/magazine/bathroom-of-the-week-modern-chic-and-wheelchair-accessible-stsetivw-vs~166603397,"Many renovating homeowners are interested in adding accessibility or aging-in-place features to their bathrooms, but they worry about them looking institutional. This bright, modern en suite in Louisville, Kentucky, which designer Bethany Adams designed for a client with limited mobility and her husband, should put those concerns to rest.Adams took into account ADA (Americans With Disabilities Act) standards and the retired homeowners’ current and anticipated needs when reconfiguring the layout of their bathroom, bedroom and closet. Then she installed luxe finishes and fixtures, including discreet grab bars and a barrier-free shower, that address mobility challenges without announcing them.Check out the award-winning design below and consider how applying similar strategies could allow you to age in place safely and stylishly — while also welcoming visitors of all ages and abilities into your home.Before PhotoSave Photo“After” photos by J.L. Jordan PhotographyBathroom at a GlanceWho lives here: A retired coupleLocation: Louisville, KentuckySize: 147 square feet (14 square meters); about 10 by 14½ feetDesigner: Bethany Adams InteriorsContractor: Stefan Rumancik of Designer BuildersBefore: The original primary bathroom in the clients’ older ranch house was fairly spacious, but it was long and skinny with multiple narrow doors and awkward angles. A bulky corner tub ate up much of the square footage. Navigating the room was difficult for one of the owners, who has used a wheelchair and sometimes a cane or walker since having a stroke a decade ago. Consequently, her spouse helped her with most elements of her hygiene, including showering.In addition, the room lacked the bright, modern style the homeowners prefer.Find a bathroom designerBethany Adams InteriorsSave PhotoAfter: Working with contractor Stefan Rumancik, designer Adams reconfigured the primary suite’s layout to install a large closet where the primary bedroom had been and move the primary bedroom to the spot where the guest bedroom used to be. Then they opened up the existing bathroom and installed double doors between the new primary bedroom and bathroom. The bathroom you see here is wider, brighter and much easier for a wheelchair to maneuver into and through than the original. We’ll look at all of the elements in detail, but first, scroll to the end to see the original and new floor plans.Note that for the purposes of these photos only, the bathroom was styled with a runner rug (which could be a trip hazard and hinder a wheelchair) and other items. Wall paint: Gray Owl, Benjamin Moore Bethany Adams InteriorsSave PhotoAlthough Adams had studied universal design, this was her first residential bathroom project to incorporate ADA standards.Beyond following those guidelines, she tailored the design to the client’s specific mobility issues. For example, the client has more strength in her right hand, so Adams placed fixtures and outlets accordingly.The homeowners also got design inspiration from Houzz and shared several ideabooks with Adams.11 Ways to Age-Proof Your BathroomBethany Adams InteriorsSave PhotoAdams custom-designed the client’s vanity with sufficient height, knee clearance and depth for her wheelchair to roll under it comfortably. The drawers are on the right side, making them easy for her to access with her right hand. Although the vanity appears to be floating, it actually sits on the floor and is securely affixed to the wall  to support the user’s full weight if necessary. The coordinating towel holder attached to the side of the sink doubles as a grab bar. And the Kohler Tempered faucet in polished nickel can be operated with one hand.Need a pro for your home remodeling project?Let Houzz find the best pros for youFind ProsBethany Adams InteriorsSave PhotoAlthough the spouse doesn’t use a wheelchair, his ability to age in place was a priority too. Thus his vanity, which is on the other side of the double doors, is a mirror image of hers, with the same safety features.The walnut vanities’ modern design and off-white quartz countertops would look elegant in any home — nothing about them says “accessible.” Clear glass pendant lights add another modern touch.How to Choose a Bathroom VanityBethany Adams InteriorsSave PhotoThe floor in the main area is a ceramic tile from Daltile that has a bit of texture to provide grip even when wet. It’s flush with the shower’s flat pebble-tiled floor, so there’s no threshold to step or roll over. And both floors have radiant heat, which speeds the drying process and further prevents slipping.The glass shower door, which the contractor reinforced for stability, is 36 inches wide — large enough to allow a wheelchair and, if necessary, a caregiver to enter comfortably.(Again, the runner rug was removed after the photo shoot.)Bethany Adams InteriorsSave PhotoIn the “before” photo, you can see a small octagonal window that provided the only sunlight in the room. Adams replaced it with a much larger window, and the contractor added a reclaimed-redwood screen on the exterior that lets in light but provides privacy.Shop for bathroom safety productsBethany Adams InteriorsSave PhotoThe shower measures a roomy 4⅓ by 6⅓ feet and has oversize subway tiles set in a herringbone pattern on two walls.Between them, a wall of bright white opal marble has a shelf that can be used for storage and stability. “I do them in all the showers I [design] now,” Adams says. “It’s easier for the contractor to waterproof, and I think it just looks more elegant than a little niche.”A rectangular rain shower head from the Delta Faucet Zura line is at one end of the shower.Bethany Adams InteriorsSave PhotoAt the other is a floating teak bench  — a helpful feature for people of any age who have trouble with balance, stamina or mobility — where the client can sit to shower. The plumbing fixtures, also from Delta’s Zura line, are installed on her right, where she can easily reach them, including the adjustable-height shower bar, which does double duty as a grab bar.“To be able to shower independently is a wonderful thing that most of us take for granted,” Adams says, and now it’s something her client can do.Bethany Adams InteriorsSave PhotoIn the water closet, which has a pocket door, a Toto washlet with bidet functionality assists with cleaning and drying. In addition to the attractive grab bars from Delta that coordinate with the fixtures, the toilet paper holder functions as a grab bar.“Any of these things that a person in need might reach out for — whether they intend to or not — should be really secured and have the potential to be a grab bar,” Adams says.Adams advises that even if you don’t want to install grab bars when you’re renovating or building, you can strategically incorporate blocking into the walls so the bars could be installed at a later date.“That’s an easy and relatively inexpensive thing to think about on the front end,” she says.Bethany Adams InteriorsSave PhotoOpposite the toilet is a linen closet that holds towels and a hamper. There are motion-activated LED lights in the toe-kick recess, making nighttime trips easier. (There are also motion-activated lights in the hallways.)During the day, a small fixed-panel transom window above the closet allows natural light from the shower to illuminate the room.Bethany Adams InteriorsSave PhotoAs part of the project, the windowless primary bedroom became a spacious closet with pocket doors and a vanity area sized for the client’s wheelchair.

But perhaps the most rewarding aspect of the project is that it restored the client’s ability to use her bathroom independently, which has improved both her mental and physical well-being, Adams says.Increasingly, design for aging in place is a topic Adams brings up with clients of all ages and abilities. Surely this project, which proves that accessibility and beauty can coexist, makes it an easier sell.Before PhotoSave PhotoBefore: This is the floor plan of the primary suite prior to the renovation.

61589227,10 Ideas for a Spring Home Refresh,Focus your energy on a few key spots to recharge your living space and your outlook,Laura Gaskill,https://www.houzz.com/magazine/10-ideas-for-a-spring-home-refresh-stsetivw-vs~61589227,"Short on the time (or motivation) to do a traditional spring cleaning? Try a spring home refresh instead. By focusing your cleaning energies on just a few key areas, and making a few simple and easy decor tweaks as well, your home will feel renewed and ready for the season. Read on for 10 ideas to get started.Kate Lester InteriorsSave Photo1. Freshen Up the Front Porch Clean up any porch furniture and launder or replace cushions, sweep and mop the porch floor, and lay down a new welcome mat. If you find you’ve gotten into a cleaning groove, continue on by shining up the exterior windows and giving the siding a wash. Renting a power washer is not generally necessary (and can even harm some types of siding), but a hose attachment designed to clean siding can be useful. If it’s been a while since you cleaned your home’s siding, you may be pleasantly surprised at how vibrant your house color looks when you’re done!Front door paint: Tranquil Blue by Benjamin MooreB. Jane GardensSave Photo2. Launder Rugs, Slipcovers and CurtainsWhen the soft furnishings of our home are fresh and clean, it gives the whole place a lift. Slipcovers should be replaced on the furniture while still slightly damp for the best fit. Small rugs can often be laundered at home; send larger ones out to be professionally cleaned. On a sunny day, drying white curtains outdoors on a line will help naturally whiten them. Pin them up, then enjoy a cold lemonade on the porch while they flap in the breeze.Simply Home DecoratingSave Photo3. Tidy the EntryPut away any lingering winter gear, handle piles of paperwork and clean up the newly uncluttered space. If your entry doesn’t already have storage, add a few hooks, a rack or tray for shoes and a basket to collect stray items.Simply Home DecoratingSave Photo4. Clean Interior Windows, Mirrors and Light FixturesWe all know that shiny-clean interior windows and mirrors make for a lighter, brighter home — but when was the last time you cleaned your light fixtures? Lamps, sconces and pendant lights can all accumulate quite a bit of dust and grime, eventually to the point that the amount of light given off is diminished. Gently wipe down light fixtures with a damp microfiber cloth to maximize illumination.Plain & PoshSave Photo5. Make your Kitchen Counter a Place of Peace It’s natural for the kitchen counter to accumulate stuff. It starts innocently enough: a blender for smoothies, your coffee pot, a cutting board, a bowl of fruit. But there comes a point when a cluttered counter becomes a magnet for more clutter, and pretty soon your counter is swamped with stray rubber bands, incoming mail, hair ties and half-finished homework. Clear the decks and start fresh by removing everything from the counters. Put away anything that has a home elsewhere and clean the surface. Then selectively put back only the few items you use daily or find beautiful and inspiring. Better, isn’t it?UserSave Photo6. Tweak a Photo Wall Display Changing up the art and photographs we display on our walls is a wonderful way to quickly shift the mood in a room. Consider swapping out a wall of colorful family photos for a serene arrangement of black and whites, or swap out plain mats for linen ones.Chango & Co.Save Photo7. Plant a Living Centerpiece Why fuss with flowers when you can have a green centerpiece that’s just as interesting but lasts indefinitely? Plant one or more shallow containers with a variety of succulents and line them up along the center of your dining table for a fresh, spring-inspired look. Not loving the succulents? Try planting wheatgrass instead to create the look of a spring meadow — perfect for nestling in colored eggs at Easter.OréeSave Photo8. Order or Print Some Photo Books or Pictures With so many of our photos living on the computer (or in our phones) these days, having real printed photos can feel like a luxury. If you haven’t printed any photos for a while, take some time to order books or prints, or print some yourself. Be sure to back up your photos, and label files by month and year to keep things organized from now on.Hco InteriorsSave Photo9. Clear Bedroom Clutter A clean and serene bedside makes for a more restful sleep. Remove everything from your nightstand (as well as anything piled on the floor beside it) and wipe down the table. Put away all those extra books, magazines, stray pens and old water glasses. Snip a fresh flower from the garden (or snag one from a larger bouquet in the house) and plunk it in a bud vase. Add a candle too if you like.Shop for storage and organization productsB. Jane GardensSave Photo10. Set Up Your Patio for Outdoor LivingClean patio furniture with warm, soapy water and drag it into the sun to dry. While you’re waiting, assess the state of your patio pillows and decor — wash the pillow covers, put new candles in candleholders and lanterns and make a list of anything you’d like to add this year. Perhaps cafe lights, or a new throw?Tell us: Do you do spring cleaning?

80583370,The Most Common Kitchen Design Problems and How to Tackle Them,Check out these frequent dilemmas and expert tips for getting your kitchen design right,,https://www.houzz.com/magazine/the-most-common-kitchen-design-problems-and-how-to-tackle-them-stsetivw-vs~80583370,"When it comes to kitchen planning, designers hear the same complaints from homeowners about what’s wrong or frustrating about their kitchens. Most of these recurring problems — and their resulting complaints — stem from a kitchen not having been designed with the owners’ needs in mind (often the case, of course, with inherited kitchens). If you hire good designers, they’ll spend time asking you how you live in your home; how you use, or would like to use, your kitchen; and about your lifestyle, tastes and habits. You could get a head start by making a list of your kitchen likes and dislikes, frustrations and wishes, to help you avoid the issues outlined below. The photos below show examples of good design and how to successfully handle common kitchen design problems. Atlanta Remodeling & ConstructionSave PhotoNot Enough StorageOne of the most common kitchen design problems resulting from poor planning is insufficient storage. This can easily lead to clutter, mess and frustration. Yet even in really small kitchens, generous upper and lower cabinets should be achievable — you just need careful and sometimes imaginative planning to fully maximize the space. Kitchen corner units, for example, can make use of otherwise unused space. In cases like this, pullout corner organizers keep contents accessible.Similarly, drawers offer more generous storage for pans than cabinets do and are easier to access. Another option for a small kitchen is upper cabinets that extend to the ceiling, with a stool nearby for reaching the highest items.  There are also lots of clever storage options to consider, such as secret drawers or hidden spice racks, and many kitchen storage options are specifically designed for smaller items, such as gadgets, handheld appliances and utensils. Carefully thinking about your storage needs from an early stage of the design process will ensure that you include enough of it and, in the long term, make for a much happier kitchen environment.Find a kitchen designer on HouzzBaran Studio ArchitectureSave PhotoBadly Planned Layout and WorkflowA poor kitchen layout will make you work much harder than necessary and ultimately stop you from enjoying it. Your kitchen should work specifically for you, with a workflow and layout designed to cater to your individual needs.For this to happen, your designer must enquire about your lifestyle, habits and kitchen requirements, as well as how many people live in your house, who likes to cook and what your preferred cooking style is. All this information should be used in the planning of your layout.While a lot of designers still plan using the traditional kitchen triangle, I think defining separate areas or zones for prepping, washing and cooking can result in a more efficient and personalized design. This approach allows fluidity in the positioning of the different areas of the kitchen.And, as in this example, your kitchen should look good too!Shop for counter stoolsTriVistaUSA Design + BuildSave PhotoInsufficient Counter Space Where NeededA lack of countertop space, or counters not being positioned where you need them, is a common design problem. It can also prove to be one of the most frustrating, since your counter is needed for just about every activity you’ll carry out in your kitchen.The countertop forms part of the kitchen workflow, so this will help to determine where and how much of it you need. A common mistake is not leaving sufficient space next to or opposite a fridge or an oven. With a fridge, this counter space is merely convenient, but having space next to or opposite an oven and a cooktop, as seen in this scheme, is also important for safety. This way, you shouldn’t find yourself carrying piping-hot food across your kitchen, looking for a counter on which to set it down.During planning, it’s important to think about all the ways in which you currently use, or intend to use, your countertops. For example, you may want space for more than one person to cook at once, or maybe an area where your partner can sit and chat to you while you cook, or it may be important to include somewhere for the kids to do their homework.New to home remodeling? Click here to learn the basicsHudson HomeSave PhotoTraffic Through Your Working AreaAs suggested, you may want enough countertop space for more than one person to operate in your kitchen at once. However, you need to consider how to achieve this so that users don’t get under one another’s feet while trying to reach the fridge, oven or sink. Similarly, if you have children, you may want to ensure that they won’t come charging past as you’re carrying hot food or handling sharp knives. Both are examples of how traffic can become a problem in a kitchen’s work area, but they are preventable through careful planning. This may mean setting up two separate and well-spaced prep zones or ensuring that there’s only one kitchen entry point, so you can easily see who’s coming or going, as shown. You can also make sure that frequently used appliances, such as the fridge, are on the periphery of your kitchen, so other household members can still get things out of them without having to fully enter the kitchen (also illustrated here).LWK London KitchensSave PhotoBadly Spaced Cabinets and AppliancesIt’s important that cabinets and appliances, while well-positioned for easy use, are also well-spaced. For example, walkways should be about 36 inches wide so that doors and drawers can open clear of one another. Similarly, they shouldn’t be too far apart: For the sake of a smooth workflow, you shouldn’t have to take more steps between appliances than is necessary.  Similarly, it’s important not to place wall ovens and microwaves so high that you can’t safely remove hot food from them. Think also about which way your cabinet and appliance doors open. For maximum ease of use, and where it’s possible, these should swing according to the surrounding kitchen space.Jessica Nelson DesignSave PhotoPoor VentilationAppropriate ventilation — such as with a range hood — allows the removal of grease, steam and cooking smells. These can otherwise linger on you, your clothes or any furniture, which is especially unpleasant in open-plan spaces.Choose the best-quality model you can afford, and ensure that you pick the right size of ducting to fit your chosen hood. This should make for quieter, more effective extraction that’s also more energy-efficient and less likely to break. Consider, too, how much noise your potential range hood will make; another common mistake is not choosing a model with a quiet motor.This is particularly relevant if your kitchen is part of an open-plan living space, or is big enough that everyone frequently gathers in it. They should comfortably be able to have a conversation or hear the TV while someone else is cooking.burlanes interiorsSave PhotoInadequate Room for Trash and RecyclingIncluding sufficient trash space to suit a household’s needs is something that’s often overlooked. Often a trash bin is present and fits neatly within a cabinet so that it maintains the kitchen’s clean aesthetic (and conceals smells). But the reality is that the container is too small and  fills up too quickly, meaning constant emptying.  Or another common problem is that there’s no provision for separating and storing recyclables. As with many of the other design problems covered here, this one usually comes about because the designer hasn’t understood the homeowners’  requirements, dictated by how many people are in the house, how often they cook, their style of cooking, and whether recycling is important to them. Providing a container with a larger capacity, one with separate compartments (as pictured) or a kitchen waste disposal unit are effective solutions to consider.B & J Custom CabinetsSave PhotoInsufficient Task LightingAnother common complaint is not having enough task lighting. This kind of lighting is important, as it focuses direct light onto specific sites. These are mainly areas where you’re preparing and cooking food, such as the countertop, stove and sink areas.Counters used for food preparation are often positioned directly under upper cabinets, so without additional lighting here, these cabinets can easily cast shadows and darken the surface, making cutting, slicing and other food preparation more challenging than it should be, or even potentially dangerous.Again, this one is easily avoidable. Solutions include spotlights recessed into the underside of upper cabinets, or cabinet lighting to let you easily see the full contents of your cabinets. You may also make a focal point of your task lighting, such as installing statement pendants over an island, successfully combining practicality with high visual impact.Bluestem RemodelingSave PhotoPoorly Planned Outlets and SwitchesOften, you don’t realize that electrical switches and outlets aren’t where you need them until after a kitchen is finished. We all use our kitchens differently, and your designer should take your needs into account when positioning these items. So don’t be afraid to convey your wishes. If you’d like additional outlets or a particular finish for the switch plate besides the standard white, this needs to be established during the planning stage. Keep in mind, though, that the placement of electrical outlets is subject to safety regulations. Your designer should be able to advise you on these rules during the planning stage.Kitchens by EileenSave PhotoTell us: What kitchen design problems have you experienced?

While electricians install lighting, lighting designers help to illuminate lives. Read on to discover how a lighting expert can highlight a designer\u2019s vision, implement the latest lighting technologies and help improve your mood and safety. TG-StudioSave PhotoLighting Is More Than Just Electricity Many lighting decisions are unfairly placed on the shoulders of the electrician. Skilled electricians are worth their weight in gold. They know the codes, the techniques and the tools to get a job done right. But asking them to understand the architecture of the space, your lifestyle and habits and the ever-expanding world of lighting technology is placing undue burden on their shoulders.Find a lighting designer on HouzzEldorado StoneSave Photo1. Help Highlight a Vision What\u2019s the use of a beautiful home if you can\u2019t see it? A good lighting designer knows this and will support, not supplant, the creative vision of an architect, interior designer and homeowner. A lighting designer\u2019s goal should be to enhance your house through careful illumination.  When you enter a room and flip a light switch, your perception of everything in it is affected by light. Lighting can help you see everything in the room, but lighting designers can help you see what you want to see. The same bathroom may feel like a prison cell or spa just by changing the room\u2019s lighting scheme.Shop for bathroom vanity lighting Greenstar TechnologiesSave Photo2. Tap Into Their Technological Know-How It has never been easier to craft amazing spaces with light, but at the same time, it has never been easier to fill our homes with glare and discomfort.  Lighting technology has made great advancements in the last decade, yet many homes feature almost identical solutions from 40 years ago.  A lighting designer can help you layer light in a room from the floor to the ceiling. They can also help you select the right color temperature bulbs for your space and install smart-home devices that will adjust interior lighting throughout the day. Lighting designers stay abreast of the newest technologies to find those that will help you enjoy your home more.Lori Dennis, ASID, LEED APSave Photo3. Build a Brighter Life Lighting designers have a vast toolbag of techniques to improve the quality of light in your home. The results of poor lighting are typical in many houses: Too many soaking tubs have lights that shine in your face while you try to relax. Too many living rooms are lit from just the ceiling. And too many kitchen countertops are covered in shadows. Light, when artfully designed, will not only make your house look better, it will also make you feel better. Studies show that proper lighting can trigger neurological responses in your brain that can help improve your mood.Our need for more light increases as we age, but often our lighting stays exactly the same. A good lighting designer will design a space for your eyes now and in the future. Light can help us balance better at night and age in place with lower risk of falls.Dedicated full-time professional lighting designers spend their lives understanding the science and art of light so they can help you live a better life.

Designs for years, but they knew that the firm was far away in Texas. However, when they called principal designer Ginger Curtis, their timing was perfect. \u201cI\u2019d made it a goal to take on out-of-state projects in 2021,\u201d Curtis says. \u201cAnd we had worked with lots of clients from Los Angeles who had relocated to Texas, so having our first remote project in that area was a great fit.\u201d During an  initial visit to the home, the design team got to know the homeowners, performed a site survey and interviewed receivers. Then, working with contractors that the homeowners had hired, it remotely coordinated and executed the full remodel of the first floor, the bedrooms and a study, returning at the end of the process to install everything. The result is a wonderful balance between dramatic and serene, chic and comfortable.Urbanology DesignsSave PhotoPhotos by Lauren Pressey PhotographyHouse at a GlanceWho lives here: A couple and their two elementary-school-age childrenLocation: Westlake Village, CaliforniaSize: 3,000 square feet (279 square meters); four bedrooms, four bathroomsDesigner:  Urbanology DesignsContractor: Focil ConstructionThe homeowners have two elementary-school-age kids, so rather than having a formal living room and a more casual family room, the team made both rooms a hybrid of the two. This one is the first room seen after walking through the front door. \u201cThe low ceiling in here was a big design challenge,\u201d Curtis says. \u201cBut I Iove a challenge, because they are almost always the greatest design opportunities.\u201d She decided the answer was to paint all the walls and the ceilings a deep green-black. \u201cHaving any breaking point in the color would have highlighted just how low the ceilings were,\u201d she says. In addition to tricking the eye into ignoring the ceiling height, the dark color also helps camouflage the large TV that was the husband\u2019s big must-have. \u201cThe dark color was risky for a main living space, but we felt confident it was the right choice, especially with all the great natural light in the room,\u201d Curtis says. Find an interior designer on HouzzUrbanology DesignsSave PhotoHigh contrast is a key signature of the firm\u2019s style. \u201cThe chandelier adds so much drama to the moody room,\u201d Curtis says. The way it hovers close to the ceiling is a good fit for the ceiling height.Another of the firm\u2019s signature moves is designing one-of-a-kind pieces for its clients. Curtis designed the white oak casework that houses the TV, media equipment and games. \u201cI just love asymmetry and try to incorporate it in our designs,\u201d she says. On the right, a stepped-up tabletop provides room to tuck two stools underneath. \u201cWe always like to find a way to add extra seating,\u201d Curtis says. \u201cThese velvet-topped stools add so much beauty to the room, and they can also use them as ottomans or to place a tray.\u201d The spot can also serve as an extra homework station. \u201cA part of using asymmetry successfully is creating balance,\u201d Curtis says. \u201cAnd we love to play with scale.\u201d Here, a large-scale sconce on the right creates balance with the floating shelves  on the left.Wall paint: Black Forest Green, Benjamin Moore  Shop for a chandelierUrbanology DesignsSave PhotoAnother reason the dark color works so well is that the room gets a lot of bright Southern California  light through the windows and doors. All the sofas in the house are custom. \u201cOne of the homeowners has back problems and so they had very specific seating requests \u2014 there are no chairs in this room,\u201d Curtis says. \u201cThese sofas are not as deep as the average sofa and are structured, yet they are very comfortable. Designing a custom sofa is also great because you can get the size for the room exactly right.\u201d Find the right sofa for your homeUrbanology DesignsSave PhotoThe pass-through to the kitchen was existing. Curtis used it to create an attractive seating area with a quartz waterfall counter and oak counter stools.Should You Go Custom? Home Professionals Weigh InUrbanology DesignsSave PhotoThe kitchen isn\u2019t very large, but it feels open and airy thanks to the lack of an island. A vintage rug adds a warm touch on the floor. A large pantry cabinet is on the left. The backsplash is handmade terra-cotta tile. \u201cWith the open view of the kitchen, we knew we needed a color that would play well with the dark green,\u201d Curtis says. It also adds a warm organic element to the kitchen. Because of the vertical orientation of the tiles, Curtis knew she needed to balance in some horizontality. The striped Roman shade over the window creates a large horizontal element, as do the white oak accents pieces on the cabinetry, vent hood and  open shelves.Find a local tile professionalUrbanology DesignsSave PhotoThe open shelves give the homeowners a chance to display a few favorite things. The faucet, hardware and lights add the shine of brass to the room.Urbanology DesignsSave PhotoAn undermount sink maintains a streamlined look. One big splurge was the stunning faucet, which serves as a focal point in the center of the room. The countertops are a pretty quartz with a marble-like veining pattern. Faucet: AtmosphyreUrbanology DesignsSave PhotoThis banquette area serves as an eat-in space off the kitchen. Curtis custom-designed the oval dining table. The oversize ribbing on its base is another play on scale. The curves of the table, banquette seat and sculptural chandelier play off one another.Urbanology DesignsSave PhotoThe paneling along the back wall of the banquette brings a powerful punch of color into the room. The rich green creates a connection to the living room. And a ledge that tops the paneling provides a spot to display art. Banquette color: Regent Green, Benjamin MooreUrbanology DesignsSave Photo\u201cThis house satisfied my stylistic split personality,\u201d Curtis says. \u201cI love dark and moody and I love peaceful and calm.\u201d The  second living-family room is the latter, with a bit of moodiness coming in through art and accents. Two  custom structured sofas provide the specific comfortable seating the homeowners needed. An oversize coffee table fits the center of the room just right. And layered rugs add softness, texture and color. \u201cThe top rug adds some unexpected peachy-pink tones,\u201d Curtis says.  The bottom rug is jute with a crisscross pattern. This room has higher ceilings, so Curtis added wood beams for warm contrast and to tie into where the ceiling drops on the left side of the room. The beams also add an architectural element to the space.Urbanology DesignsSave PhotoA stone side table adds an organic element and a sculptural shape to the room.Urbanology DesignsSave PhotoOne of the dark and moody pieces of artwork is digital \u2014 a Frame TV that hangs over the fireplace.  Curtis centered the seating area around the fireplace, which she redesigned. \u201cIt was just a sad little box insert before,\u201d she says. Now it has a larger firebox and a plaster surround that adds subtle texture. The bench seat in the foreground helps create an open feel when entering the room. The dark armoire in the corner houses the media equipment, provides additional storage and adds contrast to the light color palette.Urbanology DesignsSave PhotoA chunky console table catches the eye. \u201cI love this piece because it\u2019s the first thing you see when you walk into the room and it\u2019s a nice place for the eye to rest. It\u2019s a fun play on scale and it\u2019s very architectural,\u201d Curtis says. New to home remodeling?

The framed piece over the bed is a vintage textile. The ceiling fixture ties together a natural woven material and brass.  \u201cIt also added another shape to the room,\u201d the designer says.Urbanology DesignsSave PhotoThe vintage rug brings in soft and muted tones. The nightstands add wood grain patterns, and the sconces have playful gold discs. \u201cThe light bounces off the gold in a really pretty way,\u201d Curtis says.Urbanology DesignsSave PhotoThe design team added vessels for plants throughout the house. These provide beautiful shapes, organic textures and a place for greenery.Great communication with a strong contracting team and the receivers was key to the success of working remotely for the first time. \u201cThis project was a real milestone for us and the homeowners could not have been lovelier,\u201d Curtis says. \u201cThey reminded us that what we are able to do for clients is so meaningful. We were proud that we could do it remotely and it made us eager to do it again.\u201d   More on HouzzTour more homesHire a local design proShop for your home", "tags": ["Transitional Homes", "Houzz

She devised a soothing cream-toned color palette, brought in luxurious furnishings and found ideal spots to display works of art from the homeowners\u2019 collection.The third-floor master bedroom features a vaulted ceiling and a wood-burning fireplace with intricate detailing on the mantel. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to distract from those architectural details, so I chose a muted color palette,\u201d Mackie says. \u201cI added texture by using different materials, such as leather, faux fur, metal, glass and wood. There\u2019s so many ways to add contrast other than using bold colors.\u201dWall color: Navajo White, Benjamin MooreInspired InteriorsSave PhotoMackie likes to set a mood for every room she designs; she calls this one \u201csexy and soothing.\u201d The creamy hand-stitched leather Italian bed from Giorgetti is among the standout pieces. \u201cI love its lines,\u201d she says. \u201cLook how the headboard curves around at the base.\u201d To continue the romantic boudoir vibe, Mackie selected a photograph of a geisha from the homeowners\u2019 art collection to hang over the bed. Floral designer Roberto Gonzalez arranged the two vases of red roses on the nightstands to play off the bright red lips in the photo. Mackie picked up the gold LED chandelier from a trade show in Paris. \u201cWhen I found the chandelier a few years ago I had never seen anything like it,\u201d she says. \u201cNow I see similar designs popping up all over the place.\u201dFind round LED chandeliers Inspired InteriorsSave PhotoThe maser bedroom\u2019s seating area features a mix of new and vintage pieces. The owners already had the antique Japanese tansu-style armoire and dresser flanking the fireplace. \u201cThey both fit so perfect in those niches, you would think they were custom-made for the space,\u201d Mackie says.Mackie covered two new club chairs in silver crushed velvet and stationed them in front of the fireplace with a faux sheepskin-covered ottoman in between. \u201cThe owners love to come home after a long day and sit in front of the fireplace with a glass of wine,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is their little getaway.\u201dChairs and ottoman: Brabbu Inspired InteriorsSave PhotoA set of double doors lead to the master bathroom. The luxurious space features a floor covered in a mix of solid marble with an inlay \u201crug\u201d of marble hexagon tiles. A built-in bathtub includes a decorative wood surround. \u201cThe bathroom was brand new and featured all this beautiful marble, but it also felt somewhat sterile,\u201d Mackie says. To add color and texture, the designer covered the walls in a Maya Romanoff wallcovering made out of thin strips of wood veneer.Inspired InteriorsSave PhotoThe wood veneer wall covering features a subtle houndstooth pattern that Mackie selected as linear contrast to the tub and vanity\u2019s rounded curves.

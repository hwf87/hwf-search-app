        "details": "Electricity is the source that makes light possible, but light can do so much more than just fill a room with lumens and watts. While electricians install lighting, lighting designers help to illuminate lives. Read on to discover how a lighting expert can highlight a designer\u2019s vision, implement the latest lighting technologies and help improve your mood and safety. TG-StudioSave PhotoLighting Is More Than Just Electricity Many lighting decisions are unfairly placed on the shoulders of the electrician. Skilled electricians are worth their weight in gold. They know the codes, the techniques and the tools to get a job done right. But asking them to understand the architecture of the space, your lifestyle and habits and the ever-expanding world of lighting technology is placing undue burden on their shoulders.Find a lighting designer on HouzzEldorado StoneSave Photo1. Help Highlight a Vision What\u2019s the use of a beautiful home if you can\u2019t see it? A good lighting designer knows this and will support, not supplant, the creative vision of an architect, interior designer and homeowner. A lighting designer\u2019s goal should be to enhance your house through careful illumination.  When you enter a room and flip a light switch, your perception of everything in it is affected by light. Lighting can help you see everything in the room, but lighting designers can help you see what you want to see. The same bathroom may feel like a prison cell or spa just by changing the room\u2019s lighting scheme.Shop for bathroom vanity lighting Greenstar TechnologiesSave Photo2. Tap Into Their Technological Know-How It has never been easier to craft amazing spaces with light, but at the same time, it has never been easier to fill our homes with glare and discomfort.  Lighting technology has made great advancements in the last decade, yet many homes feature almost identical solutions from 40 years ago.  A lighting designer can help you layer light in a room from the floor to the ceiling. They can also help you select the right color temperature bulbs for your space and install smart-home devices that will adjust interior lighting throughout the day. Lighting designers stay abreast of the newest technologies to find those that will help you enjoy your home more.Lori Dennis, ASID, LEED APSave Photo3. Build a Brighter Life Lighting designers have a vast toolbag of techniques to improve the quality of light in your home. The results of poor lighting are typical in many houses: Too many soaking tubs have lights that shine in your face while you try to relax. Too many living rooms are lit from just the ceiling. And too many kitchen countertops are covered in shadows. Light, when artfully designed, will not only make your house look better, it will also make you feel better. Studies show that proper lighting can trigger neurological responses in your brain that can help improve your mood.Our need for more light increases as we age, but often our lighting stays exactly the same. A good lighting designer will design a space for your eyes now and in the future. Light can help us balance better at night and age in place with lower risk of falls.Dedicated full-time professional lighting designers spend their lives understanding the science and art of light so they can help you live a better life.

        "details": "This Southern California couple had been admiring the work of Urbanology Designs for years, but they knew that the firm was far away in Texas. However, when they called principal designer Ginger Curtis, their timing was perfect. \u201cI\u2019d made it a goal to take on out-of-state projects in 2021,\u201d Curtis says. \u201cAnd we had worked with lots of clients from Los Angeles who had relocated to Texas, so having our first remote project in that area was a great fit.\u201d During an  initial visit to the home, the design team got to know the homeowners, performed a site survey and interviewed receivers. Then, working with contractors that the homeowners had hired, it remotely coordinated and executed the full remodel of the first floor, the bedrooms and a study, returning at the end of the process to install everything. The result is a wonderful balance between dramatic and serene, chic and comfortable.Urbanology DesignsSave PhotoPhotos by Lauren Pressey PhotographyHouse at a GlanceWho lives here: A couple and their two elementary-school-age childrenLocation: Westlake Village, CaliforniaSize: 3,000 square feet (279 square meters); four bedrooms, four bathroomsDesigner:  Urbanology DesignsContractor: Focil ConstructionThe homeowners have two elementary-school-age kids, so rather than having a formal living room and a more casual family room, the team made both rooms a hybrid of the two. This one is the first room seen after walking through the front door. \u201cThe low ceiling in here was a big design challenge,\u201d Curtis says. \u201cBut I Iove a challenge, because they are almost always the greatest design opportunities.\u201d She decided the answer was to paint all the walls and the ceilings a deep green-black. \u201cHaving any breaking point in the color would have highlighted just how low the ceilings were,\u201d she says. In addition to tricking the eye into ignoring the ceiling height, the dark color also helps camouflage the large TV that was the husband\u2019s big must-have. \u201cThe dark color was risky for a main living space, but we felt confident it was the right choice, especially with all the great natural light in the room,\u201d Curtis says. Find an interior designer on HouzzUrbanology DesignsSave PhotoHigh contrast is a key signature of the firm\u2019s style. \u201cThe chandelier adds so much drama to the moody room,\u201d Curtis says. The way it hovers close to the ceiling is a good fit for the ceiling height.Another of the firm\u2019s signature moves is designing one-of-a-kind pieces for its clients. Curtis designed the white oak casework that houses the TV, media equipment and games. \u201cI just love asymmetry and try to incorporate it in our designs,\u201d she says. On the right, a stepped-up tabletop provides room to tuck two stools underneath. \u201cWe always like to find a way to add extra seating,\u201d Curtis says. \u201cThese velvet-topped stools add so much beauty to the room, and they can also use them as ottomans or to place a tray.\u201d The spot can also serve as an extra homework station. \u201cA part of using asymmetry successfully is creating balance,\u201d Curtis says. \u201cAnd we love to play with scale.\u201d Here, a large-scale sconce on the right creates balance with the floating shelves  on the left.Wall paint: Black Forest Green, Benjamin Moore  Shop for a chandelierUrbanology DesignsSave PhotoAnother reason the dark color works so well is that the room gets a lot of bright Southern California  light through the windows and doors. All the sofas in the house are custom. \u201cOne of the homeowners has back problems and so they had very specific seating requests \u2014 there are no chairs in this room,\u201d Curtis says. \u201cThese sofas are not as deep as the average sofa and are structured, yet they are very comfortable. Designing a custom sofa is also great because you can get the size for the room exactly right.\u201d Find the right sofa for your homeUrbanology DesignsSave PhotoThe pass-through to the kitchen was existing. Curtis used it to create an attractive seating area with a quartz waterfall counter and oak counter stools.Should You Go Custom? Home Professionals Weigh InUrbanology DesignsSave PhotoThe kitchen isn\u2019t very large, but it feels open and airy thanks to the lack of an island. A vintage rug adds a warm touch on the floor. A large pantry cabinet is on the left. The backsplash is handmade terra-cotta tile. \u201cWith the open view of the kitchen, we knew we needed a color that would play well with the dark green,\u201d Curtis says. It also adds a warm organic element to the kitchen. Because of the vertical orientation of the tiles, Curtis knew she needed to balance in some horizontality. The striped Roman shade over the window creates a large horizontal element, as do the white oak accents pieces on the cabinetry, vent hood and  open shelves.Find a local tile professionalUrbanology DesignsSave PhotoThe open shelves give the homeowners a chance to display a few favorite things. The faucet, hardware and lights add the shine of brass to the room.Urbanology DesignsSave PhotoAn undermount sink maintains a streamlined look. One big splurge was the stunning faucet, which serves as a focal point in the center of the room. The countertops are a pretty quartz with a marble-like veining pattern. Faucet: AtmosphyreUrbanology DesignsSave PhotoThis banquette area serves as an eat-in space off the kitchen. Curtis custom-designed the oval dining table. The oversize ribbing on its base is another play on scale. The curves of the table, banquette seat and sculptural chandelier play off one another.Urbanology DesignsSave PhotoThe paneling along the back wall of the banquette brings a powerful punch of color into the room. The rich green creates a connection to the living room. And a ledge that tops the paneling provides a spot to display art. Banquette color: Regent Green, Benjamin MooreUrbanology DesignsSave Photo\u201cThis house satisfied my stylistic split personality,\u201d Curtis says. \u201cI love dark and moody and I love peaceful and calm.\u201d The  second living-family room is the latter, with a bit of moodiness coming in through art and accents. Two  custom structured sofas provide the specific comfortable seating the homeowners needed. An oversize coffee table fits the center of the room just right. And layered rugs add softness, texture and color. \u201cThe top rug adds some unexpected peachy-pink tones,\u201d Curtis says.  The bottom rug is jute with a crisscross pattern. This room has higher ceilings, so Curtis added wood beams for warm contrast and to tie into where the ceiling drops on the left side of the room. The beams also add an architectural element to the space.Urbanology DesignsSave PhotoA stone side table adds an organic element and a sculptural shape to the room.Urbanology DesignsSave PhotoOne of the dark and moody pieces of artwork is digital \u2014 a Frame TV that hangs over the fireplace.  Curtis centered the seating area around the fireplace, which she redesigned. \u201cIt was just a sad little box insert before,\u201d she says. Now it has a larger firebox and a plaster surround that adds subtle texture. The bench seat in the foreground helps create an open feel when entering the room. The dark armoire in the corner houses the media equipment, provides additional storage and adds contrast to the light color palette.Urbanology DesignsSave PhotoA chunky console table catches the eye. \u201cI love this piece because it\u2019s the first thing you see when you walk into the room and it\u2019s a nice place for the eye to rest. It\u2019s a fun play on scale and it\u2019s very architectural,\u201d Curtis says. New to home remodeling? Click here to learn the basicsUrbanology DesignsSave PhotoThe serene feeling continues upstairs in the primary bedroom. \u201cTheir room was small and simple, and we just wanted to make it a place that made them feel happy when they entered it,\u201d Curtis says. \u201cI wanted to give their bed earthy tones, then added a little pop with the forest green pillow and bench cushion.\u201d  Simple woven shades, linen curtains and a linen headboard contribute to the calm feel. The framed piece over the bed is a vintage textile. The ceiling fixture ties together a natural woven material and brass.  \u201cIt also added another shape to the room,\u201d the designer says.Urbanology DesignsSave PhotoThe vintage rug brings in soft and muted tones. The nightstands add wood grain patterns, and the sconces have playful gold discs. \u201cThe light bounces off the gold in a really pretty way,\u201d Curtis says.Urbanology DesignsSave PhotoThe design team added vessels for plants throughout the house. These provide beautiful shapes, organic textures and a place for greenery.Great communication with a strong contracting team and the receivers was key to the success of working remotely for the first time. \u201cThis project was a real milestone for us and the homeowners could not have been lovelier,\u201d Curtis says. \u201cThey reminded us that what we are able to do for clients is so meaningful. We were proud that we could do it remotely and it made us eager to do it again.\u201d   More on HouzzTour more homesHire a local design proShop for your home",

She\u2019s a partner at an investment firm, he\u2019s a founder of a tech company.  Location: ChicagoSize: About 500 square feet (46.5 square meters) Designer: Emily Mackie, Inspired Interiors  This newly built house in the Ravenswood neighborhood of Chicago provided a blank slate for interior designer Emily Mackie to create a relaxing retreat for two homeowners with busy lives. She devised a soothing cream-toned color palette, brought in luxurious furnishings and found ideal spots to display works of art from the homeowners\u2019 collection.The third-floor master bedroom features a vaulted ceiling and a wood-burning fireplace with intricate detailing on the mantel. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to distract from those architectural details, so I chose a muted color palette,\u201d Mackie says. \u201cI added texture by using different materials, such as leather, faux fur, metal, glass and wood. There\u2019s so many ways to add contrast other than using bold colors.\u201dWall color: Navajo White, Benjamin MooreInspired InteriorsSave PhotoMackie likes to set a mood for every room she designs; she calls this one \u201csexy and soothing.\u201d The creamy hand-stitched leather Italian bed from Giorgetti is among the standout pieces. \u201cI love its lines,\u201d she says. \u201cLook how the headboard curves around at the base.\u201d To continue the romantic boudoir vibe, Mackie selected a photograph of a geisha from the homeowners\u2019 art collection to hang over the bed. Floral designer Roberto Gonzalez arranged the two vases of red roses on the nightstands to play off the bright red lips in the photo. Mackie picked up the gold LED chandelier from a trade show in Paris. \u201cWhen I found the chandelier a few years ago I had never seen anything like it,\u201d she says. \u201cNow I see similar designs popping up all over the place.\u201dFind round LED chandeliers Inspired InteriorsSave PhotoThe maser bedroom\u2019s seating area features a mix of new and vintage pieces. The owners already had the antique Japanese tansu-style armoire and dresser flanking the fireplace. \u201cThey both fit so perfect in those niches, you would think they were custom-made for the space,\u201d Mackie says.Mackie covered two new club chairs in silver crushed velvet and stationed them in front of the fireplace with a faux sheepskin-covered ottoman in between. \u201cThe owners love to come home after a long day and sit in front of the fireplace with a glass of wine,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is their little getaway.\u201dChairs and ottoman: Brabbu Inspired InteriorsSave PhotoA set of double doors lead to the master bathroom. The luxurious space features a floor covered in a mix of solid marble with an inlay \u201crug\u201d of marble hexagon tiles. A built-in bathtub includes a decorative wood surround. \u201cThe bathroom was brand new and featured all this beautiful marble, but it also felt somewhat sterile,\u201d Mackie says. To add color and texture, the designer covered the walls in a Maya Romanoff wallcovering made out of thin strips of wood veneer.Inspired InteriorsSave PhotoThe wood veneer wall covering features a subtle houndstooth pattern that Mackie selected as linear contrast to the tub and vanity\u2019s rounded curves.

        "details": "Whether you\u2019re in the middle of a bathroom renovation or in the initial planning stages, you shouldn\u2019t forget about your shower floor. While it may be easy to get hung up on your space\u2019s style and color palette, it\u2019s a detail for which function is important. Not knowing the cost, slip resistance and upkeep of what you\u2019re buying can send your investment down the proverbial drain. To help you decide on the best option for your shower, here are six common types of shower floors at a glance. Martha O'Hara InteriorsSave Photo1. MarbleMarble is a soft stone with an even softer look. The two most popular finishes are polished (classic gloss) and honed (matte finish). The swirls of gray and cream are enough to make homeowners swoon, and its popularity isn\u2019t going away. Pros: The biggest advantage of marble is, naturally, its beauty. It\u2019s luxurious, elegant, timeless and romantic all at once. Marble is also surprisingly versatile. It can be made in many different shapes, from subway tile and herringbone to basket weave and standard four-by-fours. This variety is much appreciated.Cons: So it scratches. And stains. It may not seem like a big deal, but a shower space gets covered with soap and suds, which can leave a filmy substance on marble\u2019s surface over time. A good sealer is a must. Honed marble has better scratch resistance than polished marble. In general, its slip resistance isn\u2019t the best compared to tumbled travertine or porcelain tile. Marble can also hike up your shower\u2019s price tag.Save PhotoThe many shapes and styles of marble allow you to create brilliant texture-on-texture contrast. This traditional shower space complements the brick wall tile with a basket-weave-patterned floor, which adds subtle contrast to the design.Shop for marble tile on HouzzART Design BuildSave Photo2. Travertine It\u2019s hard not to find a style of travertine you love, whether it\u2019s chiseled, honed, polished or tumbled. This natural stone has the best of earth\u2019s creams, browns, grays and golds packaged into designer tiles that grace homes across the world. Pros: Home buyers love travertine, and not just because of its veins and swirls. They also appreciate the slip resistance it offers, particularly that of tumbled travertine, as well as how long it lasts. Cons: Travertine is porous, so you could find yourself in hot water if you forget to seal it. It is recommended that you seal it every one to two years unless your sealer lasts longer. Other than that, your main concern is staining. Anything other than a mild detergent can affect the stone\u2019s surface. Be careful how you clean it and be careful of the soaps and shampoos you use.TG-StudioSave PhotoYou can install travertine on your shower floors in a variety of sizes, including (but certainly not limited to) standard 12-by-12-inch tiles, 4-by-4-inch squares and 2-by-2-inch mosaics.Find a bathroom designer near you on HouzzCeltic Custom HomesSave PhotoThis traditional shower has 4-by-4-inch travertine tiles on its floor and walls, which create depth and intrigue. Sean Murphy Contracting INC.Save Photo3. GlassCool, clean and contemporary, glass mosaics can insert a pop of color or stroke of glossy white on your shower floor. Pros: Looking for low maintenance? Glass may be the floor for you. It\u2019s super easy to clean. Just grab Windex and a cloth to give it a quick wipe-down. Its translucent surface can keep your shower space light and open. It almost always looks high-end, no matter what you actually paid for it. Cons: The price isn\u2019t always right. Quality glass can take a toll on your wallet. And unfortunately, it feels as sleek as it looks. The slip resistance is minimal, which could be a deal-breaker. Older or very cautious homeowners should seek something with a better grip if they\u2019re set on a glass shower floor.KellyBaronSave PhotoGlass mosaics can blend colors together with an iridescent, glossy or matte finish. The mosaic in this Mediterranean shower gives the space a designer touch by complementing the soft green wall tile.Browse glass tile in the Houzz ShopLondon BasementSave Photo4. PorcelainNow here\u2019s a shower floor that just might have it all. Made with a dense clay body, porcelain tile is durable and waterproof, and lasts for decades.ZeroEnergy DesignSave PhotoPros: Porcelain tile is highly versatile. It can survive detergents, scratches and long-term water exposure. It can be finished to have an authentic wood, stone or marble appearance. The best part? It accomplishes all of this without being high-maintenance. Expect to enjoy cleaning it (or the lack of cleaning, rather). Cons: Grout can be a problem. Rectified porcelain can keep grout joints small, but grout will no doubt be there for you to clean. It can get slick if it doesn\u2019t have a textured surface.Becker Architects LimitedSave Photo5. WoodWood can bring warmth and exquisite style to your shower floors. It also lets homeowners create a flat, smooth shower entry.Pros: Wooden shower floors have a sleek, minimalist look perfect for contemporary shower spaces. They sit slightly above your shower base and have slats, which allow for good draining when they\u2019re installed correctly. Moisture is less likely to fester. Wood also wears well if you maintain it (make sure you follow maintenance instructions regarding how to seal it). Cons: We all know about wood and water. Long-term exposure to moisture can cause wood to warp, discolor and fade. You won\u2019t have direct access to your shower drain either. Your drain can get icky in the long run. Not surprisingly, wood can be costly.Laura Bohn Design AssociatesSave Photo6. PebblesWith a soothing touch and an organic look, pebbles can make any bathing experience feel refreshing. Pros: The texture of pebbles offers sufficient slip resistance because of the grip it provides to your feet. They have fairly broad appeal to home buyers. Just as with other natural stones, you can\u2019t beat their one-of-a-kind beauty. And, truthfully, there might not be an easier way to incorporate a piece of the spa into your bathroom. Cons: There\u2019s a lot of grout to clean, and it\u2019s a large part of your floor\u2019s aesthetics. While slipping isn\u2019t a concern, the hard, rocky surface is. It can hurt your feet and be difficult to stand on while you\u2019re showering. In areas with hard water, a chalky film can develop on the surface of pebbles, which will require daily maintenance.Shop for pebble tilesMelissa Winn InteriorsSave PhotoFlat-surface pebbles are a viable solution if you\u2019re keen on the look but are worried about how regular pebbles will feel on your feet, though you\u2019ll still have to clean the grout.More on Houzz20 Sensational New ShowersPhoto Flip: 50 Showers That Create a SplashFind bathroom remodelers near youShop for bathroom tile",

        "details": "If you watched the popular Netflix series following Marie Kondo as she guides clients through decluttering and organizing their homes, you probably already have a good idea of the benefits of paring back your belongings. What you may not realize is that the KonMari method is just one approach. In my work as a professional home organizer, I\u2019ve found that some people need more assistance with the process. Good professional home organizers tailor their services to match the client\u2019s needs and particular organizing challenges. Here are seven roadblocks to reducing belongings that a professional organizer can help you address.Wood CustomsSave Photo1. Feeling Overwhelmed A good home organizer knows how to break a large job into manageable pieces that feel less daunting. Marie Kondo recommends that clients organize by category \u2014 starting with clothes. Her approach has the clients pile all their clothing on a bed to be sorted. Though this works for some, many of my clients would be overwhelmed by a ceiling-high heap of clothes on their beds.With our clients, we instead recommend dividing belongings into smaller, more manageable subcategories, such as dress pants. We remove all dress pants from the closet so that the client can see exactly what he or she owns, compare the items and eliminate any ill-fitting or outdated pants. Then we move on to another category of clothing.At the end of the organizing session, we help the client hang clothes neatly by type, season and color. Smaller apparel gets folded vertically in drawers so that the entire contents of a drawer are visible at a glance. Vertical folding also allows clients to easily remove items without messing up the organization of a drawer.Again, methods for decluttering vary, and approaching the challenge by category is just one possibility. Some of our clients prefer finishing one room at a time. A good organizer can flex the approach to meet the needs of the client.Find a professional home organizer near you on HouzzUserSave Photo2. Young Children For some of our clients, hiring a baby sitter is not an option. A good organizer can keep the process moving forward even with minimal interaction with a busy parent. For example, we recently decluttered and organized a large kitchen for a pregnant client with a 3-year-old son. While our client volunteered in her son\u2019s preschool classroom, we started on the pantry, pulling out all food and discarding anything stale or expired. Next we removed the pots, pans, bakeware, utensils, small appliances, tableware and party supplies from the cabinets and grouped items by category. When our client returned home, she could quickly assess each category and see that she did not need three vegetable peelers or a waffle maker that she hadn\u2019t used in years. Next we discussed storage solutions with the client and got her input. She then left for the remainder of the day to attend to her son. We stayed and arranged her items on the appropriate shelves and drawers. We measured the cabinets and drawers and recommended some storage containers that our client could purchase to corral her smaller utensils and food items. A few days later, we returned to unpack the new storage containers and fill them with the appropriate items. Our client had spent very little hands-on time during the process but was extremely pleased with her decluttered, organized kitchen.Find kitchen storage items on HouzzMurs et MerveillesSave Photo3. Lack of TimeIf time is a problem due to work or other commitments, a good organizer should be able to manage a large project on his or her own. As with hiring a contractor to remodel your bathroom, you should be able to trust an organizer to work independently without constant supervision.Before hiring someone, I recommend that you read reviews and ask about a business license and insurance. You might interview the organizer over the phone to see if you\u2019re comfortable with the pro\u2019s approach and communication style. It\u2019s a good idea to be available for an hour or so on the first day to give an overview of the project and answer any questions. Recently, we worked with a professional couple with young children who had just moved into a large home and desperately needed help unpacking and organizing their belongings. On the first day, our client worked from home, gave us an overview of her needs and then handed the project over to us. We jumped right in, unpacking boxes and measuring belongings. By the end of the day, we recommended storage containers she could purchase online. On subsequent days, we removed the key from a handy lockbox and let ourselves in. We continued organizing while our client and her spouse were at work. Over the course of a week, we unpacked boxes of books, kitchen items, clothes and other belongings and neatly organized them in closets, drawers and cabinets. By the weekend, our clients were able to relax and show off their new home to family and friends.Light House Architecture & ScienceSave Photo4. Lack of Energy A good professional organizer can make the process easier for people who lack energy, whether due to aging or poor health. When a client has a lifetime\u2019s worth of belongings to sort through, sometimes decisions take more time. Or a client may need to take frequent breaks or remain seated during an organizing session. A good organizer is compassionate and nonjudgmental yet keeps the client moving forward. A few years ago, we worked with an elderly, blind woman who was moving to a new home and needed help sorting through four large closets filled with clothes she had accumulated over many decades. We began by asking our client about the types of clothes she enjoyed wearing now \u2014 and she said items that were comfortable and stylish. She also said that we could donate formal dresses, business clothes, shoes with a heel, and anything that showed signs of wear. She wanted to say goodbye to items smaller than a size 12 and anything from the 1970s or \u201980s. Even after eliminating items in these categories, we were still left with a large collection.Next we selected current, comfortable clothing and created coordinated outfits for her. She sat in a comfortable chair while I described each ensemble to her. I was rewarded by the recognition on her face as she recollected clothes she had not seen in years. I also helped her select a few dresses, a winter coat, several jackets and multiple pairs of shoes. We packed the items our client wanted to keep and arranged for a donation pickup for the rest. Our client felt ownership in the process because she was making the decisions. And she did not lose steam because she took frequent breaks and we did not overwhelm her with too many choices.Ecraft LLC.Save Photo5. A Short Deadline Many of our clients decide to move and then face a quick timeline for packing, donating, selling or tossing their belongings. In our experience, the timeline from listing with a real estate agent to hosting the first open house is often quite short, and a sale can happen fast. A good professional organizer can take the stress out of the process \u2014 both in terms of readying the home for an open house and getting ready to actually move.We recently worked with a client who had lived in her home for 40 years and was downsizing to a retirement community. She had only a few weeks before her home was going on the market. We worked with her room by room to help her decide what to pack, donate, sell or toss. Then we packed \u2014 including purchasing moving boxes, tape and other packing supplies. We donated her excess items to a charity, sold some items at a local consignment store and ordered a dumpster from the local waste management company for items that were trash. We also identified local places that she could dispose of hazardous waste, including old paint, and took care of those items for her.Read more stories on organizing and declutteringPure & Simple OrganizingSave Photo6. Difficulty Making DecisionsSome of our clients need a little more hands-on coaching when it comes to deciding what to keep and what to let go. A good professional organizer can be immensely helpful with decision-making. For example, many clients have feelings that hold them back from making decisions. Common issues include fear that they may regret letting go of something they might need later, fear of getting rid of something valuable, guilt over not finding a good home for an item and guilt over getting rid of something sentimental, inherited or that was a gift. A good organizer understands these emotions and can compassionately guide clients through difficult decisions. Sometimes a client just needs permission to let something go.Of course, if there is a question about whether something is valuable, we recommend consulting an appraiser.6 Emotional Challenges You May Face When Tackling ClutterAlison Kandler Interior DesignSave Photo7. A Partner Who Isn\u2019t on BoardAn extremely common problem for many of our clients is a partner who does not want to declutter. A good organizer can get past this hurdle with a variety of approaches depending on the situation. Recently, we worked with a client whose partner was visibly stressed by the thought of getting rid of anything. He agreed to leave the house while we focused only on the willing partner\u2019s belongings. We then spent the first day decluttering and donating a large quantity of her clothes, making sure to get the donation bags out of the house before her husband returned. We meticulously organized her remaining belongings in her drawers and closets. When her husband returned, he was so impressed with our work that he agreed to let us help with his belongings on our next visit. The husband had very little he wanted to part with, so we focused on organizing his things for efficiency. We removed sentimental clothing he no longer wore \u2014 old college sweatshirts and old sports uniforms \u2014 from prime storage areas and placed them in storage containers on high closet shelves. We encouraged him to toss unusable clothing like socks without mates and clothes with rips or stains. Beyond that, he kept everything. We hung and folded remaining items neatly by category, season and color. Rearranging his items opened up some space in drawers and closets, which was more visually pleasing and an encouragement to him to keep things neat in the future. He had not gotten rid of much, but he and his wife felt happy with the organization.If your partner is unable to let go of unsentimental items like excess plates or too many vegetable peelers, simply stay focused on decluttering what you can: your personal belongings. Neatly organize the rest.Decluttering and Organizing When Your Family Is Not on BoardSornell Design and DevelopmentSave PhotoA final note: As you\u2019re looking for a professional home organizer to work with, keep in mind that flexibility and good communication skills are key attributes that make the relationship smooth. You also want someone you are confident can manage a project and help you overcome any of your own decluttering obstacles. If in doubt, hire an organizer for one day to see if the fit is good before committing to a whole house declutter.

Over the years, islands have risen to the top of kitchen wish lists during house hunts and renovations. However, some people like the idea of substituting the island with a large table instead. This could be due to the renewed love affair with the American farmhouse  or the desire to bring back nostalgic ideals embodied by the old-style “eat-in” kitchen. The pros of having a kitchen island  are numerous, and the feature  isn’t going away in the foreseeable future. But for those in a position to decide between the two, here’s the case for the eat-in kitchen table. Van Wicklen DesignSave PhotoThere’s a revival going on in this kitchen, and I want a part of it! With a view, bright light, ample cabinetry and comfortable seating at a long farmhouse table, this is most certainly a well-used spot in the house. Tip: When considering a table in lieu of an island, ask yourself if there will be enough storage without the additional storage that islands provide.Find a local kitchen designer on HouzzKELLY + CO DESIGNSave PhotoA big table allows the kitchen to function as a dining area in a way most smaller eating nooks can’t. This is a definite plus if the home has no formal dining room. People who have a table in their kitchen say that the biggest upside is the comfort it brings. Tip: If you love to bake or cook things requiring a lot of peeling and prep, like jam, a table provides a work area with comfortable seating to get you off your feet.Wendi Young DesignSave PhotoWhen chairs surround the table, as opposed to the typical island where stools are along one side and occasionally an end, everyone can sit facing one another. This is an advantage for those wanting to use the kitchen for most meals.Smith & Vansant Architects PCSave PhotoKey in permitting a table to become a practical choice is adequate counter space for food preparation along the kitchen’s perimeter.Gilbert | McLaughlin | Casella Architects, PLCSave PhotoSome homeowners would argue that a sizable table lends itself to a warmer and more friendly atmosphere than a big boxy island. Bringing a large table into the center of the kitchen welcomes family and friends to gather and linger.Browse dining tables in the Houzz ShopLoafSave PhotoThe lower height of a table and chairs, compared with a typical island and stools, provides comfortable seating to sit back and relax, not only for eating but also for the other activities of a busy family, such as crafts, homework and game night.Turner PocockSave PhotoIn contrast, the stools selected for islands often aren’t as user-friendly as chairs, particularly when they’re backless. And if children are sitting on taller bar stools, their feet may not reach the floor.Aviad Bar-NessSave PhotoThe kitchen’s layout largely influences the choice between a table and  an island. While tables do work in  open floor plans, they make the most sense in kitchens that are separate from other areas of the home.Tip: If there is available wall space, placing the table along a wall, as opposed to the middle of the kitchen, is a functional option.Shop for dining chairs on HouzzCallender Howorth Interior & Architectural DesignSave PhotoIn a closed-off kitchen like this, a table is often the most practical choice when there’s no room for both an island and a smaller nook table. This is in contrast to the layout prevalent in typical new-construction homes featuring an island paired with an adjacent nook meant for a smaller table, with the larger table set nearby in the dining room.Nathalie Priem PhotographySave PhotoHere is another example of a kitchen where a table works best, especially since the floor plan of this London flat doesn’t  include a nook or dining room.Vibe Design GroupSave PhotoAvailable space is also a determining factor. Will there be enough clearance between the table and surrounding cabinetry? While the rule of thumb is to allow 3 feet between an island and cabinetry, and 3½  feet for appliances,  you’ll need a bit more space for the table to function at its best. In this ample kitchen, what’s more welcoming than a rustic picnic table for simply hanging out?Jason Arnold InteriorsSave PhotoHomeowners who are on the table side of the discussion simply like the coziness a table provides. From farmhouses, country homes to city chic abodes, there are many kitchens where a table can be the smartest choice.More on HouzzRead more kitchen design storiesFind a kitchen remodelerShop for kitchen products",

The Renewal of Vows has given you the strength you need to continue on, and now we’re finally, and gratefully, just about out of phases. It’s time to wrap up this series on the ups and downs of remodeling by detailing the final few steps that are taken to complete a home remodel. What I call the Happily Ever After phase. Karia DesignsSave PhotoWhether you have experienced it, known someone who has gone through it or have only read about it, you’re probably familiar with what it’s like to be in love. Emotions run the gamut of excitement, happiness, giddiness and contentedness (as well as a wide range of others). The person in love is likely to be gushing about her beau or his sweetheart to anyone who will listen. It’s a time when even the most cynical of people looks at the world through rose-tinted glasses.Moving back into a house after remodeling can be a bit like being in love. Are you not excited to use all your new appliances or plumbing fixtures? (Hello, new bathtub!) Is there not a smidge of giddiness as you think about coming home to your pristine new bathroom, kitchen or living room? Don’t deny it — you’re probably even babbling to the barista at Starbucks about your new space.During this Happily Ever After stage, finally, the work is done! At last, there are no more nail guns and saws and vacuums making noise in your house. After months of destruction and disarray, it’s time to move back in and enjoy your home, sweet home, for the rest of your days (or at least until you sell it or remodel again). And though most of this phase is just you at last having the chance to enjoy the fruit of your general contractor’s labor, there are a few odds and ends that your contractor will be taking care of to make sure your Happily Ever After really lasts forever.Sandifer Design BuildSave PhotoCleaning. This probably will happen before you move back into your home (or at least it should). Since day one of demolition, dust and debris have been thrown into the air and, much to your contractor’s chagrin, have crept into other places in the house that weren’t touched in the remodel. Now’s the time to do an all-inclusive clean. No, the cleaners won’t do your laundry for you, but they’ll do just about everything else, from polishing the floors to dusting the ceiling fans. The end-of-project clean is like a cleansing spa day for your home.Read more on controlling dust in your homeLaura Grist Interior DesignSave PhotoFinal walk-through. The last walk-through ensures that you are completely satisfied with everything — and I mean everything — in your home. This is where you will have the chance to sit down and bring up all the odds and ends that you feel need to be addressed. This can be anything from “this faucet isn’t on straight” to “there’s a scratch on the new fridge” to “my shower isn’t draining correctly.”Contractors may vary on when they hold a final walk-through, but in my experience, it’s scheduled after the homeowners move back in and have a chance to use the new space. Your contractor should’ve caught just about everything during his or her own informal walk-throughs throughout the remodel, but sometimes there are items that just don’t come to the surface until a house is lived in.MetamorphosisSave PhotoWarranty begins. Most builders and remodelers have a warranty for their projects. The length and amount of coverage can vary, of course, but what remains constant is the promise to stand behind their work for any unforeseen circumstances that arise and need addressing. (Side note: If you’re looking at contractors right now, ask them about their warranty. This can be very telling of how they conduct their business. The more that contractors are willing to warrant their work — or the longer the warranty — the more effort they will put into getting the job done right the first time.)Judd BuildersSave PhotoFor some contractors, the warranty formally begins after the final walk-through is hosted and the last payment is received. After that, some will stand behind any light fixtures that fizzle, appliances that break, tiles that come loose — you name it. In an ideal world, everything would work right the first time, and it would work right forever. In our world, however, there are bad manufacturing batches and recalls and oversights that may need to be taken care of. Fear not. If you have selected the right remodeler, these issues will be handled.Read more about contractor warrantiesMGM BuildersSave PhotoWhat else is involved in the Happily Ever After? Absolutely nothing. Take a deep breath in, let it out, look around your new place and smile, knowing that it’s all yours, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish till death do you part.

Fortunately, some lucky Houzzers don’t have to look far to feel as if they’re getting away from it all: They’ve created their own outdoor retreats at home. Last month, nearly 200 homeowners and designers showed us their private outdoor sanctuaries, including a walled castle garden by the waterfront. Here are 20 of our favorites.Save PhotoSave Photo1. Beachy retreat. In Carlsbad, California, just north of San Diego, Houzz user paulalack enjoys views of the nearby Pacific Ocean from the ipe deck she built in front of her coastal cottage. An evergreen hedge along the street maintains privacy while also framing her ocean view.With the lounge furniture, outdoor rug and plenty of throw cushions, this deck’s appeal is clear — we can see why she sometimes spends the night outside,  listening to the waves and enjoying the cool air all evening long. Save PhotoSave Photo2. Secluded garden destination. An area close to Houzz user sriinmt’s home allows friends and family to gather and relax on two cushioned benches near the comforts and conveniences of the house. Nestled into a corner of the garden, two bistro chairs framing a ceramic garden stool offer intimate seating.Save Photo3. Breakfast with a view. On her covered patio in Portugal, Gina Rantanen enjoys snacks, sunshine, stunning views and a daily cup of coffee.Save Photo4. Garden sanctuary. Houzz user Jo’s favorite outdoor nook is this serene deck space, nestled between the front door and a neighbor’s garage. “Since it gets morning sun, the herbs, tomato and mini bog garden can enjoy the day, and we can savor a glass of wine after work in the shade,” Jo says. Wood sling chairs and a painted rug center the intimate seating area, with leafy green foliage encircling it, spilling over the deck’s edges. The white flowers of oakleaf hydrangea (Hydrangea quercifolia) stand out in the garden’s sea of green.Save Photo5. Easy front porch. Donald describes his front porch as “my favorite place to be…every summer day.” He might also be speaking for the furry dog we see relaxing on the thick lawn next to it. Regardless, with the light concrete floor, dappled shade (both from the roof overhang and the mature shade tree) and relaxed patio furniture, this front porch is a great spot for taking in the day — and catching up with neighbors.Save PhotoSave Photo6. View of the trees. From their newly built porch in Ontario, Canada, Jody Scott and her husband can enjoy uninterrupted views of trees and the nearby Beaver Creek. Painted crisp white and decorated with wicker furniture and driftwood art, the porch feels fresh and breezy and welcomes in plenty of natural light. “We are spending so much time out here now,” Scott says. “It’s a real treat.”Save PhotoSave Photo7. Room for a friend. Hello Pity has transformed a tiny balcony in Seattle into a container-garden oasis — in this case, for one “fat kitty.” The potted Platinum Blonde lavender with variegated foliage, seen in the foreground, “grows like wildfire on balconies,” Hello Pity says, adding that “it was supposed to be a figurative fire pit, since our condo doesn’t allow open flames.”Save PhotoSave Photo8. Rustic dining patio. You don’t often hear that a truckload of black locust logs — or any type of logs — inspires a backyard project, but nevertheless, that was the case with this covered eating area in a photo uploaded by George Pendleton & Co.Framed by retaining walls, this rustic stone patio is used for activities ranging from evening cookouts with friends to enjoying quiet mornings with coffee.Save PhotoSave Photo9. Midwestern rooftop relaxation. From the roof of a two-story loft condo near Chicago, drheidi64 has a great spot for relaxing and entertaining in private. The roof features a hammock, an outdoor kitchen and dining area, and an edible garden. On the sectional sofa next to the fire pit, this Houzzer likes to get a nap in on a cool night after enjoying a delicious alfresco meal.FOXY OXIE StudioSave Photo10. Staged for gathering. Oksana Radionova of Foxy Oxie Studio shared a photo of the deck off her home in the South, decorated for hosting a social event. “We do have a few more projects planned for this area,” she says, including staining the deck and planting climbing plants. “For now, we’re so excited to enjoy the space as is.”Save Photo11. Indoor-outdoor living. Houzz user kfcohen’s recently renovated outdoor sala (Spanish for “living room\") blends the indoors with the outdoors, opening directly to a garden. This home is in San Miguel de Allende, a Unesco World Heritage Site in central Mexico.Save PhotoSave Photo12. Porch life. The front porch in this photo uploaded by Susan shows that even a narrow outdoor space — this one is 4 feet by 15 feet — can be a great place to sit and relax. She says it’s the perfect size for her husband and her. “We sit outside every day,” she says. “We love it.”Save PhotoSave Photo13. Castle garden. From the protection of her walled castle garden in the town of Castelo de Vide in Portugal, Diane Jacobsen can enjoy the sun, the plants and the rocks.Save Photo14. Shaded terrace. Houzz user qurashi brought a taste of Italy to this rooftop terrace in Pakistan. The spot is “my little piece of Tuscany in Islamabad.”Save Photo15. A circle around the fire. This luxe outdoor seating nook shows how focusing on one element in a design — and doing it well — can pay off in a smaller space. Designed by K&D Landscape Management, this patio features four oversize lounge chairs encircling a small fire pit.Save Photo16. Colorful view. While a stunning view can make any outdoor nook feel more special and inviting, not all of us are lucky enough to have one at our disposal. Toni Zody improved the look of a cinder block wall off her back patio — and gave it a midcentury modern vibe — by painting some of the blocks bright colors.Save Photo17. Just add string lights. Houzz user carolb99 offers a great mantra and inspiration for homeowners looking to create a relaxing outdoor nook a home: “[Make] a life we don’t need a vacation from.” From the looks of this outdoor setup, it looks like carolb99 has the right thing going.Save Photo18. Serene simplicity. For Chad T., an inviting outdoor nook doesn’t need to have more than a bar stool, a balcony-height table and a good view. “It is just enough to sit, relax and enjoy the view,” he says.Save Photo19. Postcard of paradise. Adam P’s 1905 Beaux Arts balcony has been outfitted with small American flags for Memorial Day, but that surely isn’t the only time he uses it. “One chair is all I need to enjoy beautiful sunset views over the park,” he says. The taller potted plants help shelter the seating area from strong winds. “My next trick? Trying to get a clematis vine going on the sunnier side of the railing.”Save Photo20. A taste of Provence. A patio umbrella, two bistro chairs and the sound of trickling water in this outdoor space nearly transport you to the French countryside. Take a cue from Bosler Earth Design: If you don’t have a garden nook but want the feeling of intimacy, create one with patio furniture.Your turn: Share a picture of your small, beautifully lived-in patio, balcony or other outdoor nook in the Comments section below.MoreDiscover more small outdoor spacesSet Up Your Patio for Ultimate Lounging — Whatever Its SizeBrowse outdoor lounge furniture",

All that changed when Sacramento native Greta Gerwig made the city a character in her 2017 solo directorial debut, Lady Bird. “I wanted to make a love letter to Sacramento as seen through the eyes of someone who can’t appreciate how beautiful it is until she’s going away to someplace else,” Gerwig told the Sacramento Bee. Gerwig’s semiautobiographical coming-of-age story, about a girl in her senior year at a Catholic high school, draws on elements of her childhood that mirror some of my own and that have resonated with audiences nationwide. Her tender, humorous and bittersweet film made me laugh in recognition and brought tears to my eyes for the nostalgia it evoked. The movie is nominated for five Academy Awards.Save PhotoSaoirse Ronan and Lucas Hedges star in “Lady Bird.” Photos by Merie Wallace, A24, except where notedWatching Lady Bird was a strange and exhilarating experience. There was my hometown, shot in loving detail: the tree-lined streets of East Sacramento, the rose garden at McKinley Park, the neon-topped Tower Theatre, Cookie’s Drive In, the Pasty Shack, the meandering Sacramento and American rivers, the H Street Bridge and, just outside the city limits, the farmland that stretches to the horizon. And there were the details of my teen years: the school theater productions and prom night, the Masses and assemblies, the joys and angst of relationships and family life, the reminders of wealth and class (hello, house envy) and the yearning to leave Sacramento behind for a more exciting world.Save PhotoDirector of photography Sam Levy and director-screenwriter Greta Gerwig on the set of “Lady Bird.” Gerwig’s attention to the details of place and time, and the specificity of her characters, have given her movie universal appeal. Critics have lavished praise on Lady Bird, audiences nationwide have embraced it, and the low-budget indie has grossed nearly $50 million to date. The film has picked up numerous awards this year, and on Sunday, March 4, it will compete for Oscars in the categories of best picture, director, original screenplay, actress (Saoirse Ronan) and supporting actress (Laurie Metcalf). Sacramento also has embraced the movie, which is being shown there at the Tower Theatre. One company has launched Lady Bird-themed walking and running tours to highlight local spots associated with the movie. (Gerwig shot some scenes in Southern California and New York.)Save PhotoThe movie gets so much about Sacramento exactly right, including the role that the Fabulous 40s neighborhood plays in the city’s imagination. The well-to-do East Sac neighborhood of sprawling Colonial Revival, Tudor, Mediterranean and Craftsman houses custom-built in the early to mid-20th century is where many of the city’s affluent and influential families live. To some who reside in more modest homes but attend school or work with those who live there, it can seem a world of parties and privilege. That’s how it seems to Christine “Lady Bird” McPherson (Ronan), above left, and her best friend, Julie (Beanie Feldstein), above right, who in this scene are walking through the Fab 40s neighborhood in their school uniforms, gazing at the homes and imagining how wonderful their lives would be if they lived there. Lady Bird’s family lives in a small ranch house where five people share a bathroom. Julie and her mom live in a nondescript apartment. The elegant houses in this neighborhood seem like heaven in comparison. The girls stop in front of a blue Colonial-style home with an expansive front lawn. “If I lived here I would definitely have my wedding in the backyard,” Julie says. Lady Bird says: “I’d have friends over all the time to study and eat snacks. I’d be like, ‘Mom, we’re taking the snacks upstairs to the TV room.’” “I’d have my own bathroom,” Julie adds.Save PhotoThe 1935 house, above, shows up again when Lady Bird joins her new boyfriend, Danny (Lucas Hedges), for Thanksgiving dinner with his family. Lady Bird is astonished to learn (spoiler alert) that his grandmother lives in the home. Suddenly the magical world that once seemed out of reach is within her grasp. That night she brags with comic exaggeration to Julie that the house someday could be hers. Later, with a wealthy new friend, her imagination and her desire to be accepted take her a step too far. Still, Lady Bird is starting to get hints that this dream world may not be exactly what she imagined. She tells Danny’s grandmother that her house is her favorite in East Sacramento. She then spots a framed “Reagan Country” poster on the wall and wonders if it’s a joke. (In real life, the house, at 1224 44th St., is a block from the Reagan-era governor’s mansion.) Lady Bird  eventually learns that Danny has his own struggles. And, at another stately house where she spends time with a boy, she finds unexpected sadness.Save PhotoPhoto by Merrick MortonThough a beautiful home may not inoculate you from all of life’s struggles, it certainly can provide pleasure. When Lady Bird’s mother, Marion (Metcalf, pictured above), a psychiatric nurse, picks her daughter up from the boy’s home, she sees how distraught she is and consoles her with an offer: “You want to do our favorite Sunday activity?” Lady Bird dries her eyes and nods. It’s time to tour open houses.Soon the two of them are walking up the wide front porch steps of a large house and meeting a real estate agent in the foyer. They walk  through beautifully appointed rooms with gleaming hardwood floors and antique wood furniture polished to a high sheen. In an inviting kitchen, they gaze out the windows of a sunny breakfast nook as if the home were their own. Mother and daughter bond over aspirational real estate, and life is good again.The McPhersons’ own kitchen, pictured above, is unimproved and showing its age. Their bathroom is a sea of pink tile.Save PhotoParents Larry (Tracy Letts) and Marion, pictured above, though struggling financially, are devoted to their children and have worked hard to care for them and raise them well. It’s something the rebellious Lady Bird, like teenagers everywhere, doesn’t always fully appreciate.Save PhotoDirector-writer Gerwig has described her movie as being about what home means, and how difficult it is to see it clearly when you’re there. With Lady Bird, the now-New Yorker has shown that if she didn’t see her hometown before, she definitely does now. And she’s letting the rest of the world see it too.Tell us: Has your perception of your hometown changed with time? Do you ever visit open houses just for fun?

                    "details": "There was his voice — gravel mixed with sweetest honey. There was his trumpet — soaring, wistful, exuberant. When Louis Armstrong put voice and horn together in a song, he could make you smile, make you dance and maybe make you fall in love. Save PhotoPhotos from Shore Fire Media except where noted; photo from the Louis Armstrong House MuseumArmstrong introduced that most American music, jazz, first to his nation and then to the world.  In recordings like Sleepy Time Down South, Mack the Knife, Hello, Dolly! and What a Wonderful World, in musical collaborations with Billie Holiday and Ella Fitzgerald, in decades’ worth of shows at venues as varied as Harlem’s Cotton Club and Buckingham Palace, he proved that a boy born in abject poverty in segregated New Orleans could become a musical titan and an American icon. As contemporary jazz master Wynton Marsalis said of Armstrong, “More than any other musician’s, his sound carries the feeling and the meaning of jazz.” In the Corona neighborhood of Queens, about 35 minutes from Manhattan, the beautifully restored Louis Armstrong House Museum lets you experience the lives of this American genius and his wife Lucille.  Like Armstrong himself, the house is a mix of the simple and the glamorous — and is almost impossible not to love.Save PhotoPhoto from the Louis Armstrong House Museum‘We Stay Put’Louis Armstrong didn’t buy this 1910-vintage, two-story house at 34-56 107th St., Queens. His fourth (and final) wife, Lucille, did, in 1943, shortly after they married.  As a trumpeter and bandleader, Armstrong was on the road much of the year. Still, both he and Lucille realized they needed a home base. She put a down payment on the 11-room, 3,000-square-foot, $16,000 house while he was on tour. As he recalled in Louis Armstrong, In His Own Words, when he returned to New York, he took a taxi out to Queens to see the home his wife had bought and thought it was too good to be true. “One look at that big fine house, and right away I said to the driver,  ‘Aw man quit kidding and take me to the address that I’m looking for.’”  Louis’ love for this house and his working-class neighborhood would last the rest of his life.  Later, as his fame and wealth increased, he and Lucille could have afforded something larger and grander. But Louis refused to budge. As he wrote in the “Our Neighborhood” recollection in the book, “We don’t think that  could be more relaxed and have better neighbors any place else. So we stay put.”Peter FishSave PhotoPhoto from the Louis Armstrong House Museum“The house may not be the nicest looking front,” Louis Armstrong wrote in “Our Neighborhood.” But when visitors come inside, “they see a whole lot of comfort, happiness + the nicest things.”  Step into the Armstrong home and you see he’s right. Lucille, a former Cotton Club dancer and Queens native, had a sure eye for interior design. Working with Manhattan interior designer Morris Grossberg, she created a home more luxurious than it appeared from the street. In the midcentury modern living room, sea grass wallpaper (Lucille loved wallpaper) sets a serene mood. Cabinets showcase objets d’art that the Armstrongs collected on their world travels. And a Calvin Bailey oil portrait, based on a 1935 Vanity Fair photograph, shows Louis mopping his brow happily, trumpet in hand.Peter FishSave PhotoEveryone’s Favorite RoomOne look at this sleekly streamlined, brilliant aqua blue kitchen will show you why Armstrong museum guides say it’s everybody’s favorite room in the house. Lucille remodeled the kitchen in the late 1960s to be functional as well as stylish. There’s a double-oven Crown stove, custom-made — as a plaque attests — “For Mr. & Mrs. Louis Armstrong”; a built-in countertop NuTone blender; and a Sub-Zero refrigerator, paneled in turquoise to match the rest of the room. The lacquered cabinets are hung on piano hinges so they can open 180 degrees.  The Armstrongs needed a state-of-the-art kitchen because, as museum archivist Ricky Riccardi notes in his charming video guide to the house, “This is a man who loved to eat. If you look at a lot of his song titles, Cornet Chop Suey and Struttin’ With Some Barbecue, he always had food on the mind.”Peter FishSave PhotoSatchmo’s DenLucille created Satchmo’s Den — Satchmo (from satchel mouth) was his nickname, for his famously wide smile — as her husband’s upstairs retreat. As a touring musician, Armstrong was away from home for as many as 300 days a year. But as he grew older, he spent more time at home and in this den, writing — he wrote two memoirs and numerous articles — and entertaining friends, many of them musicians. One of them painted the portrait of Louis that hangs here. It’s signed Benedetto — the artist is better known as singer Tony Bennett.  Also prominent is Armstrong’s large state-of-the-art Tandberg tape system, which dates from the late ’60s. Armstrong acquired his first tape recorder in 1950; from then on, his favorite hobby was making tapes of music and conversation with friends and family. As you tour the house, you’ll hear snippets of those conversations and Armstrong’s trumpet piped into the rooms.Peter FishSave PhotoLucille and Grossberg saved their greatest creative energies for the house’s two bathrooms. The downstairs bathroom is dazzlingly opulent: Its floor-to-ceiling mirrors, marble sink and floor, and gold-plated fixtures led it to be featured in a Time magazine article on celebrity bathrooms. The upstairs master bathroom, shown in the next photo, is more subdued, with silver foil wallpaper, and speakers that piped in music from the nearby den.Peter FishSave PhotoPeter FishSave PhotoThe master bedroom reflects both Louis and Lucille. He reveled in the king-size bed, while the Bible on the bedside table and a prayer nook (not shown) are testimony to Lucille’s strong Catholic faith.  Louis began to suffer from heart trouble in the 1960s, putting his health at risk by continuing to perform against the advice of his doctors. He died in his sleep, in this bedroom on July 6, 1971, a month shy of his 70th birthday. (Although Armstrong liked to say he was born on July 4, the true date was Aug. 4, 1901.) Lucille continued to live in the house until her death in 1983. She arranged to leave the property to the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs so it could be opened as a museum; today the Louis Armstrong House Museum is managed by Queens College. Construction on a new $23 million educational center, across the street from the house, began earlier this year.Save PhotoPeter FishSave PhotoVisiting the Louis Armstrong House The Louis Armstrong House Museum, at 34-56 107th St., Queens, New York, is open for 40-minute guided tours ($10 adults, $7 children) daily except Mondays, Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day.  The museum hosts numerous special events, among them its summer concert series. Called Hot Jazz and Cool Gardens, it takes place in the house’s Japanese garden, which was added by Lucille in the late 1960s.

That’s exactly what these homeowners did. They ditched their old shower curtains or took away the dull shower doors, and replaced them with glass panels and doors. Let’s take a look at five bathroom transformations that said hello to a glass enclosure on a tub-shower combo. Maybe these scenarios will clearly point you toward the right option for your own bathroom.Before PhotoSave Photo1. Closed-In Orange to Wide-Open BlueBathroom at a GlanceWho uses it: A couple and their young daughterLocation: El Segundo, CaliforniaSize: 65 square feet (6 square meters)Before: A small, oddly shaped tub bordered on three sides by orange tile wasn’t working for this family of three.Custom Design & ConstructionSave Photo“After” photo by John MoeryAfter: A new, larger tub gives the family more bathing room. Designer Natalie DiPiazza of Custom Design & Construction had to borrow space from the hall linen closet to make this expansion possible. The tub-shower combo is finished with a glass door that is hinged against the wall. The movable door lets family members turn the water on and off without having to get inside the tub. The glass also lets the graphic blue tile be a focal point in the bathroom since there’s no shower curtain to hide the lively design element.

Barely Working to Fully FunctioningBathroom at a GlanceWho uses it: A mother and her teenage daughterLocation: TorontoSize: 50 square feet (4.6 square meters)Before: Blinds and a shower curtain blocked the room’s only natural light. That combined with the fact that the shower leaked called for a bathroom overhaul.Find a bathroom designer near youThe Dickson Design GroupSave Photo“After” photo by Naomi FinlayAfter: A new frosted glass window and a clear glass shower enclosure brighten this happy bathroom, designed by Kate Dickson of Kate Dickson Design. The overhaul to the tub-shower combo makes the room feel larger and maximizes the space. The roof is sloped, so Dickson worked with the contractor to design and cut the custom glass shower enclosure. They also built a niche in the shower wall to give the clients additional storage.Browse vanities on HouzzRead more about this bathroom remodel Before PhotoEncircle Design and BuildSave Photo3. Dull Days to Glossy FutureBathroom at a GlanceWho uses it: A married couple and their young twins, a son and a daughterLocation: Portland, OregonSize: About 60 square feet (5.6 square meters)Before: A well-used porcelain tub was showing its years, and the shower curtain made the space feel closed in. Encircle Design and BuildSave Photo“After” photo by 22 Pages PhotographyAfter: The refinished tub-shower combo gleams in the bathroom designed by Michelle Ruber of Encircle Design and Build. The design-build firm, which focuses on sustainable work, had the original tub refinished. Not only did that save resources, but it also saved Ruber’s clients money. That allowed them to splurge on these aqua glass tiles. Inside, the family opted to include a shower head on the left side and a handheld sprayer along the back wall. This comes in handy when they bathe their two children. While bathing the kids, the parents can swing open the glass door. When it’s closed, the clear pane gives the room a more open, airy feel.Shop for bathroom tileRead more about this bathroom remodelBefore PhotoTKS Design GroupSave Photo4. Uncomfortable to RelaxedBathroom at a GlanceWho uses it: Adult daughters home for a visit and other overnight guestsLocation: Glen Ellyn, IllinoisSize: 52 square feet (4.8 square meters)Before: The 1970s design wasn’t aesthetically pleasing to the client, and the 1970s toilet and tub were far from comfortable.TKS Design GroupSave Photo“After” photo by Mike KaskelAfter: Patterned ceramic floor tiles and a sliding glass door give the bathroom a fresh, modern look. Designer Susan Klimala of The Kitchen Studio of Glen Ellyn used black, white and gray for most of the space, and then added in chrome and oak accents.

The 1955 Colonial-style ranch house designed by renowned local architect  Roscoe Hemenway was almost entirely in its original condition, except for its 1980s kitchen at the front of the house. A wall, fireplace, laundry room and powder room stood between the kitchen and backyard pool area, something to which the homeowners, who have lived in the home since 2006, wanted a better connection. They also thought the existing kitchen, shown here, was tight and difficult to maneuver. The cooktop took up most of the peninsula countertop, preventing seating there. That meant guests at the nearby round table became isolated from the cook.Hammer & HandSave PhotoAfter. To gain more kitchen square footage and integrate the kitchen with the rear outdoor space, they demolished the interior wall dividing the kitchen and laundry and powder rooms.  (See floor plans below.) “We carved away the existing laundry room and powder bath to create a wider, less cavernous covered outdoor living room and patio,  and filled in the existing breezeway between the garage and house to create space for the new powder bath,” says designer Geno Salimena of Gusto Design Studio. They relocated the laundry room to the basement. Cabinets. White painted custom wood cabinets and a light gray hexagon backsplash add brightness and cheer to the kitchen while allowing contrasting walnut accents to pop.Hammer & HandSave PhotoIsland. Removing the wall and chimney provided room for a larger island, more circulation and better storage. Custom scalloped tongue-and-groove Western walnut paneling, milled by Big Branch Woodworking, wraps one side of the island.  Counter-height stools at the island and a separate dining table (shown below) offer flexibility for entertaining.Ceiling vent. While the flush inset venting above the cooktop looks clean and simple, it was one of the project’s major challenges. Because of its location in the center of the kitchen, running it out a side wall wasn’t an option, and venting up through the metal roof wasn’t ideal either  as the metal roofing is nearly impossible to cut into or patch. “The owners did not want to have to re-roof the entire  house for the vent hood, so we decided to run the venting through a hole left by the chimney that had been removed as part of the renovation,” Salimena says.

Many of the original doors and windows, like the one above the sink, were in good shape. General contractor Hammer & Hand  updated them by stripping and repainting them and adding new hardware.

Previously at the rear of the house, a small cavelike covered patio  off the laundry room overlooked an uninspiring expanse of concrete.Hammer & HandSave PhotoAfter. A custom 12-foot-wide pair of sliding doors now establishes a physical and visual connection between the kitchen and the enlarged covered outdoor space.

Here’s a look at the wall that previously separated the kitchen from the backyard. On the other side was a powder room and laundry room. To the left of the bookcase is a door leading to a breezeway.The homeowners struggled with the idea of removing the original kitchen fireplace and chimney to gain the space needed for the new design. “We felt strongly that in order to make this kitchen all that it could be, the fireplace had to go,” Salimena says. “The owners took some time to mull it over and finally agreed. Once the chimney was removed, it was immediately clear that it was the right choice and they never looked back.”Gusto Design StudioSave PhotoAfter. This photo looks slightly more to the left than the previous photo but shows how, with the removal of the wall, there’s now a connection to the backyard — a portion of the new windows is seen to the right.A coffee, beverage and storage station delivers a lot of function in a compact space. Pulling off this area was no easy feat. Mac Casares, a project supervisor at Hammer & Hand, says joining multiple rooms together that were already out of square and plumb was especially challenging with corner and wrapping elements like those at the coffee bar. “The design featured many clean lines and geometric patterns, including tilework and flooring,” Casares says. “That required a great amount of forethought and planning before starting installation to keep the lines parallel and true, as well as uphold the homeowner’s and designer’s vision of a holistic kitchen space with seamless transitions between planes and materials.”The single base cabinet at the corner is a pull-down door that opens to a laundry chute to the newly relocated laundry room in the basement.

These original floor plans show the former U-shaped kitchen at the top left and the wall and fireplace in the center.

With the dividing wall and fireplace removed, the kitchen expanded to include a large island and better connection to the new pool deck. The powder room moved to a portion of a breezeway, while the laundry room moved to the basement.More: See other Kitchens of the Week",
